            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He toilſom labour which I have undertaken to endure for the common Good of all Men in the adorning of Phyſick, Part wherof ſuch as it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought forth and publiſht as occaſion was offerd, I thought fit to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, not to one Prince only, but to You
<pb facs="tcp:93060:3"/>all, as being the High Lords of Earthly things in this part of the Univerſal Orb, wherin I am born and live, to whom I doubt not but that Your Own, and Your Subjects Proſperity is Your deſire and care. Beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Good and Great God with my whole Heart, to inſpire You with an ardent deſire, and conſtant will, that Phyſic ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected (as yet deficient in many things) by the pains of excellent Phyſicians, who live under Your Power in many places, it being uſeful and neceſſary that our Courſe ſhould be happily finiſht upon Earth.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have endeavoured to do ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to the meaſure of my Ability, for the good of the Common-Wealth: But who can expect ſo great a Work of one Man, and that privat, and therfore deſtitute of infinit neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Helps to perform ſo immens and hard a Matter? But ſo much me thinks I have profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Art of Phyſic, by a continu'd pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Labour almoſt forty years, that I now dare boldly affirm, the Structure of a more perfect Edifice of Phyſic may be erected, the Authority and Munificence of Princes being employ'd with many induſtrious and judicious Phyſicians, ſo much the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
<pb facs="tcp:93060:3"/>and to be wiſht, as by how much Princes no leſs then Subjects do need its help, being afflicted unto Death with ſo many, ſo grievous, and thoſe not as yet enough known Diſeaſes, and therfore ſo often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemd inſuperable.</p>
            <p>Neither doubt I, but in a ſhort ſpace a rational and certain way of Phyſic may be found out by the propos'd Method, if not in all, yet in the moſt Diſeaſes. For which end I here offer publicly my weak Pains, if acceptable, to You, by Divine Authority ſet over the Government of others, out of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love of farther deſerving well of the Common-Wealth, ſeeing that it pleas'd the Clemency and Wiſdom of God, of mere Grace, not only to free me beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation a year agoe from a moſt grievous Diſeaſe, and in a manner from the Jaws of Death, and to reſtore not only former ſtrength of Body and Mind to me, but farther to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminat my Mind more, and hence ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully to conſent to my Wiſhes, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance hath been made daily to me more eaſie, and farther, to the dark and deepeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements of natural things.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93060:4"/>
            <p>Now, the ſame God for his unſpeakable Mercy and Goodneſs towards Mankind, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your Thoughts and Counſels to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory of his Holy Name, as alſo to Your own, and Your Subjects Health both Temporal and Eternal. <hi>Amen.</hi> Which is my hearty Prayer.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S often as any Men do endeavour, in any kind, to afford any thing that conduceth to the benefit of of the Publick, they have in all Times been thought worthy of the favour and benevolence of Great Men; but when they do indeed promote the Publick Good, they deſerve moreover to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in a well-order'd Common-Wealth: wherein, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rewards are by the Laws propoſed to Vertue, and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Vice:</hi> Therefore if at any time their excellent Performances are not only envied by Men idle and malicious, but perverted by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Cavillers, accuſed by Paraſites that have little elſe to do, and traduced by ſlanderous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators; ſo often thoſe who are in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have taken care, that they ſhould be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglected nor deſpiſed.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93060:5"/>
            <p>That I may apply theſe things, though but in part, to my Concerns, there are ſo many ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and unjuſt cenſures of my Enemies, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pretended Friends in the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> eſpecially through a falſe Prejudice, or Envy, or Hatred of my Words and Writings, that I ſcarce know whence to take a ſit beginning for my Preface.</p>
            <p>For, I ſo much eſteem my own peace, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I had already venturd, and ſomthing were already publiſht by me; which nevertheleſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good Men favouring the Common welfare do approve here and elſwhere beyond my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though my Adverſaries chafe at it; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhould have prevented by ſilence the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Cavilings and Calumnies of Ill-minded People, which have hitherto befallen me, and were foreſeen by me.</p>
            <p>Wherfore I intend to publiſh ſome of mine Endeavours and Labours, leſt many ſhould think I am brought to a perpetual Silence, by the vain Threats and injurious Calumniations of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Men, becauſe this Book, ſuch as it is, hath been ſlowly finiſht, and now alſo publiſht.</p>
            <p>For, after that I being mov'd with love to the Common-Wealth, took in hand the Profeſſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Phyſic above thirteen years ſince, which was more then once offerd to me in this Academy (although with a great deal of dammage to my
<pb facs="tcp:93060:5"/>private Concerns) thought this Buſineſs was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, that I ſhould teach mine Auditors not a few things obſervd, by me for many years privatly, amongst my Patients, and otherwiſe; but even thoſe things which were daily further to be obſerv'd, as alſo thence ſolicitouſly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and deduc'd by a continued reaſoning, and ſo both profitable and uſeful to Mankind.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, that I might rightly do my Duty, I ſpent Days and Nights both in calling ſlowly back into my Memory what I had for a long time conſiderd, and had accuratly examin'd and noted, and alſo in conferring the paſt with following Experiments, daily made at my own Coſt for common Good, as well in drawing thence Concluſions and moſt ſolid Determinations to cure the Sick, as in informing the ſtudious Youth (that came hither in a great number to hear me) faithfully about thoſe things, which I judg'd were both true and good, and alſo in a right forming of them, according to Art, for the Practice of Phyſick.</p>
            <p>Nor was ſucceſs through God's aſſiſtance wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to mine Endeavours undertaken in the fear of God, and love: whilſt Letters came from my Scholars daily, thanking me for the benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, who practis'd happily at home and elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But, as in Mans Concerns nothing is wholly bleſt, I have not been free from Envy,
<pb facs="tcp:93060:6"/>Cavilling, evil ſpeaking of malign Men, or ſuch as hated me, and whatſoever the Devil, that perpetual diſturber of Mans Tranquillity and Happineſs, uſes to ſuggeſt to his Servants.</p>
            <p>I will not farther enlarge with words upon the manifold ill-will and evil-ſpeaking of mine Adverſaries for ſome ſerious Cauſes, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at preſent to mention in a few words the detriment which is brought upon the Common-Wealth by the Cavils and falſe Accuſations of ſome.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever ſingular Gift of Mind, Body, or Fortune, every one hath receivd of God, (And I pray you what has any Man, which he hath not receivd from Above?) he is bound to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it, acknowledging the Giver with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, to the common Good and benefit of Men, never to any ones loſs or detriment.</p>
            <p>Which common good is promoted, both by ſearching out the <hi>Truth</hi> obſcur'd as yet in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things, or by illuſtrating it more or leſs hid, and by manifeſting it to others; and by ſearching out any <hi>Profitableneſs</hi> coming or likely to come from things known to Mankind, and by calling into uſe what is invented, and communicating it to others.</p>
            <p>He that doth this, is wholly to be eſtem'd for an excellent Citizen, whoſe Vertue the Parent of Roman Eloquence judg'd worthy of Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:93060:6"/>and not Envy. And indeed they are to be praiſd who emulate, and not at all to be blam'd who endeavour to overcome the Vertues and good Deeds of others; on the contrary they are to be abhord, who maliciouſly cavil, or contumeliouſly ſlander the profitable Words or Deeds of others, as oft as they cannot equal or excede them.</p>
            <p>It is moreover the property of theſe truly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable People, that they firſt envy good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtrait-way become evil-ſpeakers, being before ill-will'd.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:93060:7"/>upon themſelvs, or at leaſt remov'd from thoſe they envy. Wherfore the Study which they ought to take in acquiring Glory about honeſt Arts, they almoſt wholly ſpend in Carping, Biting, Corrupting, Confuting, and Deſaming other Mens Words, Writings, or Actions profitable for the Common-Wealth, wherby they deprive them of due, and ſomtimes attributed Praiſes, or at leaſt extenuate and diminiſh them.</p>
            <p>For this ſame reaſon, though they oft enough harm good Men, (for it is the cuſtom of moſt Men to give heed to the Publiſhers, and more to the defamers of other Mens Praiſes) yet for that reaſon there redounds none to them, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>For although many joy in Cavils and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies tending to the diſhonour of Good Men; yet ought they alſo to bate Cavillers &amp; Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, (were they prudent) becauſe they likewiſe know that they are in danger of them: as great Ones are ſaid to love the Treaſon, though they hate the Traitor.</p>
            <p>It is ſo far unlikely, that any profit ſhould befal the Common-Wealth by Cavils or Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies whatſoever, that contrarily many are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted by them from propagating their Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Obſervations with a notable loſs hereof, which otherwiſe might ſerve the Public; and being made more cautious by others or their own
<pb facs="tcp:93060:7"/>danger, they had rather that thoſe things ſhould periſh with them, (as I have experienc'd it often done to my grief in ſeveral caſes) then be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly traduc'd by mocking Cenſurers, as being ignorant of thoſe things, or be ſcurrilouſly toſs'd upon the Tongues of Vain and Evil Men by means of theſe Bablers: which will be, as long as it ſhall be lawful that any injurious Man may impudently rail at good Men, and find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with his flattering Tale among Rulers, in that not very wiſe nor prudent.</p>
            <p>Hence it coms, that God out of his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wiſdom, would not that many things, which as yet are hid from us, ſhould be found out and brought to light always at once, but by degrees, and at times, not by one, but by many.</p>
            <p>And as all good Men deſervedly praiſe Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern Authors, who have only in part ſeen many things, and have not throughly ſeen every thing, much leſs all; yet becauſe they have left to Poſterity as much as was known to them, ſo they think (becauſe it is eaſier to add to what is invented, then to invent what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known) that all do what is worth the while, who but a little promote the Bounds of Sciences and of Arts; and therfore it ſeems not only unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any that deſires the Name of a Learned and Honeſt Man, but unjuſt alſo, and ini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

            <p>But becauſe it is irkſom and grievous to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or otherwiſe lazy Men, to ſtoop to handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, it is on the contrary more pleaſant and eaſie to prate with a voluble Tongue, moſt Men being vain-glorious and ſeeking a little praiſe, though in a trivial Matter, whereby they do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb and by their importunate talking daily more obſcure thoſe things, which they know not, nor will illuſtrate by aſſiduous labour. For as they are not accuſtomd to great Labour, ſo neither are they given to it. Therfore they do worſt employ their Pains, to be able to babble about every thing problematically on either ſide as they liſt, and not to excel in endowments of Mind or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb facs="tcp:93060:8"/>to perfect any difficult Work, or to unfold, explain, or determine doubtful and intricate Matters.</p>
            <p>Mean while large Gifts are often beſtowd on ſuch Great Pratlers, and Annual Stipends for their vain and flattery-Talk; which the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of good things do for the moſt part want, being more ſtudious in ſearching out the obſcure and hard things themſelvs, then to propoſe them with handſome words, or in a ſervile manner to curry ſavour.</p>
            <p>What I have before ſaid, will be more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by an Example. It is wonderfully now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted in our Art of Phyſic, about the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Motion, and Uſe of Choler in Mans Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Where I freely acknowledg, as I have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifi'd often both in public and privat, that I cannot fully ſatisfie my ſelf hitherto in this Matter, and indeed partly by the defect of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Experiments requiſite as yet to reſolve ſome Doubts even now urging me; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſundry Experiments not having the like ſucceſs in all, nor at all times, but as it were ſomtimes repugnant one to the other.</p>

            <p>Whoever will try to effect this, ſhall have my praiſe; but who-ever performs it, ſhall more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever have me to be his faithful and certain Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower.</p>

            <p>I could indeed have brought out of my Store both more, and perhaps more perfect; as alſo greater, and more abſtruſe, and therfore better and more profitable things, if God had given me deſired leaſure to do thoſe things, which is ſcarce at any time to be expected of Men.

            <p>Mean while I teſtifie before God, the only Searcher of Hearts, that I have not Written or Taught any other thing here or elſewhere, than what ſeem'd to me true, or moſt like to Truth, and chiefly profitable to the Sick. For upon
<pb facs="tcp:93060:10"/>theſe accounts I have never with-held or ſhund any, yea not the moſt troubleſom Labour; I ſpar'd no Coſt, often great enough for my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The which Charity of mine, the moſt Merciſul God bountifully favouring, has more then once graciouſly requited, and without doubt will yet farther recompence in his own time, what all ſorts of ungrateful Men, though from them due, have often deni'd or turnd from my Merits.</p>
            <p>God grant that, as I have written theſe Things to ſerve Young Beginners of the Art of Phyſic, and (hence by their help) the Sick them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, all theſe things may tend to the good of them both.</p>

            <p>THe Tranſlator of this Book, when the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation was even quite finiſht at the Preſs, was ſent to me by a Gentleman, one of the moſt Learned in this Iſle of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> with a deſire, that if I liked the deſign of Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I would own it ſo far, as to give my Opinion about it to the World. Should I name that Learned Perſon, there is none of the moſt ſtiff Philoſophers of the Time, but would perhaps bow the Head at the bare mention of his Name; and therefore it will be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie enough for me in what I do, that I thus pay Obedience to his Deſires, which I ought to entertain as Commands upon me, in this Declaration of my Opinion.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, nothing could have been offer'd more welcome to me, in regard of the worthineſs of the Author, and of the Work it ſelf, wherein he hath done the World more Service, towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Art of Phyſick, than ever any Man did before him in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces;</hi> And in ſuch a manner, that he doth not, as ſome here in <hi>England,</hi> trifle away all time and patience in labour'd Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, more fit to tickle the fine Ears of a Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Auditory, out of the Chair of an Univerſity, than to edifie Men engaged in Practice: But like a wiſe Practitioner, ſo orders the Matter, that his Sheets may ſmell as little as may be of an <hi>Academick Profeſſor;</hi> for, the infection of thoſe places is ſo ſtrong, that
<pb facs="tcp:93060:12"/>Men uſed to Philoſophizing there with Niceties, and conjectural Probabilities, are wont, when they come abroad, to ſmell rank of it ever after in all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Diſcourſes; and ſo doth <hi>Sylvius</hi> in ſome Particulars. Their manner is to abound with Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for which having been admired by the Men of Letters in the Academy, they all believe they may ſet up for Authors of Science; though (when they come into the World) they generally prove mere Slow-Men at Buſineſs; yet they paſs as great Men among ſome Learned, and the better ſort of Men Unlearned: for, the World will ſtill be for Learning (ſo reputed) in Men of Phyſick, not being able to judg, whether that which is acquired in the uſual way of Education be learning to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To give you a more particular Account of <hi>Sylvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Author, take what I have received from the Ingenious Tranſlator, who had the happineſs to be a Scholar of his.

<pb facs="tcp:93060:13"/>Sick; in which Work of Curing he excelled all his Fellows, in the moſt difficult Caſes: Yet becauſe he had recourſe moſtly to <hi>Chymical Remedies</hi> (of whoſe ſafety and excellency the World is now convinced) the more lazie Tribe of Doctors made it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs moſt maliciouſly to calumniate and traduce him, as you will find him miſerably complaining in many parts of his Book; of whom he ſaith in 40th <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that they be <hi>ignorant of moſt Natural Things, yet are a prating Crew, that ſtrut about and ſwell</hi> inani Doctorum Titulo, <hi>with the vain Title of Doctors:</hi> they are his own words of them, and the World hath too many of them, though they and their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit wear off apace. So that now in this diſcerning Age, ſeeing the Pedantry of their Breeding, the Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain of their Philoſophy, the <hi>Theatrical Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebankerie of needleſs Niceties in Anatomy</hi> (about which they perpetually quarrel, and puzzle one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) are like to prevail no longer, to gain admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the <hi>great Vulgar,</hi> or <hi>the little;</hi> and it being found, that to Induſtry in operating one grain of Prudence being added (ſuch a Prudence I mean, as is in an Apprenticeſhip improved under a Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and by an in-ſight into Practice from ones youth) will weigh down all the <hi>Schools</hi> in a ſick Mans Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; therefore they are conſtrained to have recourſe to other Arts, to uphold that Tottering Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they have long held over the Phanſies of the People.</p>
            <p>To ſay nothing of their Flatteries among the Great and the Rich, beſides the Calumnies that they ſow againſt other Practitioners, the frequentation of Clubs and Tipple to gain Acquaintance, the gloſing Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and fine Tales with Nurſes, Midwives, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and weak People; the Confederacies to cry up
<pb facs="tcp:93060:13"/>one another with <hi>Doctiſſimo</hi> and <hi>Clariſſimo</hi> in Prints, the creating &amp; canvaſing of Intereſts in Families, and the common <hi>chequenerie</hi> of Conſultations only with Men of their own Tribe; the moſt remarkable Trick of all is, that they have an Oar in the Boat of every Party round the Town and Nation, having liſted themſelves accordingly. Some are for the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſome for the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſome for the <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> ſome for the <hi>Independent;</hi> ſome among the <hi>Baptiſed;</hi> ſome for the <hi>Fifth-Monarchiſts;</hi> ſome for the <hi>Quakers; every Man for himſelf, and God for all:</hi> And ſo the World is very luckily divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; every Party taking its own Proſelyte to be the Ableſt, and the moſt Conſcientious Doctor. Is not this a ſhort Cut (think ye) to get Cuſtom? This and Scholaſtick Twattle will do the Work, according to the general Mode of their <hi>Second Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> after which, the few Men of no Party, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Induſtry and Art be, are left to be turn'd to graſs <hi>upon the cold Common of Integrity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this latter Age, the great Pranks they play now are by <hi>mounting the Stage of Anatomy,</hi> (for that paſs 'tis now come to) where many of them are wont ever and anon, to make wondrous Oſtentation of pretended new Diſcoveries in the little World of Man; with which they have a <hi>Mint</hi> always going, for coining new <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> out of which they ſtart up their <hi>various Dogmaticiſms,</hi> to amaze their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and amuſe the World; ſo that the very Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Dogs are in as much danger of their <hi>Shambles,</hi> as they are of the <hi>Falconers.</hi> And though it be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous enough to prudent Men, yet when the part is acted it gains upon many gentle Spectators, be it in Print, or in open Lectures; ſo that they come within the reach of that <hi>Motto</hi> in the Duke's Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſus Mundus exercet Hiſtrioniam.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, it ſerves for divers purpoſes more: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which give me leave, becauſe it may be of uſe, to make publick here what I not long ſince privately wrote upon an eminent occaſion, thus.</p>
            <p>'Tis a common trick among the Tribe of Diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to open Bodies of their own or other Mens Patients, in pretence to ſatisfie themſelves, and the deceaſed's Kindred touching the cauſe of Death; and thence they always pick out enough before the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring By-ſtanders, to juſtifie themſelves and their own miſtakes, by reaſons to prove that the Patient was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable: or elſe they will be ſure to collect dirty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough, to caſt upon any Phyſician whom they envy, whoſe hap it may have been to have given Phyſick before them to the ſame Patient; eſpecially if he be not of their Honorary number: hundreds of able Practitioners and Learned, have been thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially blaſted: So that it were well if this famous City of <hi>London,</hi> would take Notice of ſuch crafty Abuſes for the future. For, though ſomtimes, when upon opening of Bodies, the internal parts appear decayed or corrupted in their Tone and Subſtance, 'tis manifeſt then what brought on Death; yet not ſo at other times, ſeeing moſt Diſeaſes lying in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations of Blood and Humors, Spirits and Ferments of the Parts, are in their Cauſes remote from ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſpection, let none in theſe Matters be gull'd hereafter. For, that nothing certain can be concluded from the ſtagnation of Blood, or other Humors found in any place or paſſage of the Body after Death, is evident in this, that Nature upon Death's approaches, being driven to moſt violent motions, doth extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate, intravaſate, throw Blood and Humors in and out, here and there and every-where, <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93060:14"/>through the moſt abſtruſe and unperceivable Paſſages. So that if ſtagnant or coagulated Blood or other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, be found in any part by Anatomizing, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be concluded it was ſo before death. For it was well ſaid of old by <hi>Celſus,</hi> the moſt prudent of all Phyſicians, in his Preface, <hi>Neque quicquam eſſe ſtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, quàm quale quid vivo homine eſt, tale exiſtimare eſſe moriente, intò jam mortuo:</hi> which is in plain Engliſh; <hi>That nothing is more fooliſh than to imagine, that things within a Man ſhould be in the ſame ſtate when he is dying, as they were when he was living, much more when he is actually dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence alſo obſerve, what miſtakes Phyſicians may be led into by blind ſuppoſals and conjectures of Blood or other matter lodged in this, that, or other ſecret Paſſage of the Veſſels, or Bowels, to be cauſes of Diſeaſes; when they proceed thereupon to raiſe fanciful Doctrines whereby to manage practice in After-time, and order Cures by Calculations, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundùm ductus &amp; Hypotheſes Anatomicos.</hi> No Man can be againſt a due enquiry into Anatomy, ſo far as concerns a being acquainted with the Structure, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Scituation and Connexion of the Parts of the Body, eſpecially in Caſes of Chirurgery, wherein its greateſt uſe doth lie; and of this alſo it becomes a Phyſician not to be ignorant, who ought alſo to be a Chirurgian; though the ſine-finger'd Academick Education of Phyſicians in <hi>England</hi> hath here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily divided the two Faculties, the Profeſſors of the one being brought up to Talk, the other to Work; the one in their youth to ſpeculative Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; the other from their very firſt youth in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Drudgery, if I may ſo call it in compariſon with the other: from whence 'tis obſervable, we are always furniſhed with far more able Chirurgians
<pb facs="tcp:93060:15"/>than Phyſicians. Conſider what greater Men ever had we in the World, for the old way of Phyſick formerly, than thoſe that were bred up Chirurgians? <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf was bred a Chirurgian. And where now will you find among the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Men for Phyſick to be named after thoſe famous Perſons bred Chirurgians; ſuch as were <hi>Pareus, Chalmetaeus, Pigraeus, Guillemeau, Ingraſſias, Felix Wurtzius, Fallopius, Veſalius, Carcanus, Severinus, Marchetti, Spigelius,</hi> and the two <hi>Fabricii,</hi> one an <hi>Italian,</hi> the other a <hi>Swiſſe,</hi> viz. <hi>Hildanus</hi> and <hi>ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quapendente?</hi> whoſe Judicious Works and great Performances, made them renowned through the world. But now forſooth a Chirurgian with us is made ſo little a thing by our <hi>Doctoral Confederates,</hi> that when he hath a Patient, they expect he ſhould not preſume to preſcribe any thing of Internal Phyſick for the promoting his Cure; though none can judg ſo well what is fit to be done as himſelf: ſo that if he gives way, he remains liable to the poſſibility of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Work ſpoiled, either, by the ignorance, or ſometimes the malice of another Perſon that knows little or nothing of the management of a Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Curation. Beſides if our Chirurgians were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded (as that's the deſire and aim of the others) from the Practice of Phyſick, I wonder where his Majeſty for his Fleets, and the Merchants for theirs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing the <hi>Juniors</hi> are not fit to be truſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board with the Seamen, and the <hi>Seniors</hi> never did ſerve nor mean to do it, and nothing but <hi>another great Plague</hi> can ſend them out of <hi>London,</hi> Which way can the Sea, or, our Armies be ſerved with Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Chirurgery, if <hi>Surgeons-Hall</hi> be not to be lookt on as a Colledge of Phyſicians? and for which of their good Services to the Crown, Kingdom, and City, will the other Society ever have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſeek an Authority, to tuck the Necks of all other Phyſicians, Chirurgians, and Apothecaries, under the Girdle of their Jurisdiction? But 'tis to be hoped the Nation will ere long be convinced, that the Laboratory, the Work-houſe is the way to be traced before we enter the Library; an Apprenticeſhip from our Youth to work and ſtudy under a Practiſer, is that only which can make one a Doctor: all the reſt is but <hi>flocci nauci nihili pili,</hi> &amp;c. Whereupon 'tis to be hoped alſo, we ſhall one day think it high time that a Reformation be thought of, that the preſent formal way (which none of the Antients knew) will be left, and our Youth for Phyſick, inſtead of being <hi>Academians,</hi> be bred up <hi>more Mechanico,</hi> inſtituted in the Operative, before the bend themſelves upon the Contemplative and Philoſophizing part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid well, <hi>Nihil in intellectu quod non priù in ſenſu, Nothing lies right in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that is not firſt collected by ſenſe:</hi> that is, by ſenſible operation. And <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non poſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem inventam eſſe Medicinam, ſed poſt inventam Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinam rationem eſſe quaeſitam; That Remedies Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
<pb facs="tcp:93060:16"/>were not found out by reaſoning; but reaſoning came in play being ſought out after Remedies had been found.</hi> From whence 'tis concluſive, That the ſure Notions of Curing are thoſe which Men form un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves: Firſt, Not by Tradition of Authors, but by reaſoning upon their own and others Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whoſe operations and Effects they have ſeen. But for Phyſicians bred the fine way, he ſaith, <hi>Etiam ſapientiae ſtudioſos maximos eſſe Medicos ſi ratiocinatio hoc faceret; nunc illis verba ſupereſſe, deeſſe medendi ſcientiam;</hi> to wit, <hi>That your Students of Philoſophy</hi> (meaning the old way of Philoſophy) <hi>were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Phyſicians, if reaſoning could make them ſo; now that ſort of Men abound with words, but want the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Curing.</hi> Yet they (he ſaith a little after) do bear away the Bell in the World, <hi>Ingenium &amp; facun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam vincere, morbos autem non Eloquentiâ, ſed Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis curari:</hi> that is, <hi>They that have a witty knack of talk, prevail above others in the Opinion of the People, though Diſeaſes are not to be cured by fine words but by Remedies.</hi> And therefore 'tis hoped the Magiſtrates, Nobility and Gentry of the Land, will accordingly ſteer their Judgment in the choice of Phyſicians, and one time or other give a helping hand towards a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the Education of Men for the practice of this Faculty. This may ſerve alſo for an <hi>Item</hi> to our young Students in the Univerſities how to prevent the leſs of time. 'Tis not a formal degree in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick that will make amends for it, or give them ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at laſt, if Men of Conſcience and Ingenuity. And as for Anatomy, I do not declaim againſt it.

But that being not to be effected, as their Leaders very well knew, becauſe I had ſaid little in my own Sence or Language, but choſe rather to cloth my ſelf with <hi>Quotations</hi> from Head to Foot, borrowed out of the Writings of the moſt Learned Men in the World, to render my ſelf as invincible as might be; and in regard they ſaw they could not invalidate me without condemning my Authors, therfore it was warily done of them to decline an endeavour of ſolid Anſwer themſelves, and to put the Task upon their Whifling Novices, who being Men ſcarce known, nor ever like to be to any purpoſe, could loſe no repute though they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed nothing worth the name of an Anſwer; while
<pb facs="tcp:93060:19"/>the other, ſtanding behind the Curtain, reckoned it enough for them, to cry up in private every-where, that I had four Anſwers given which confuted me. And to this they added their crafty Inſinuations in Diſcourſes among the weaker ſort of People, that I had printed all Men to have the <hi>French Pox:</hi> than which nothing could be more diſſonant to my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which only ſhew'd what a wonderful altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been wrought in the whole Frame of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature by divers Accidents; and among the reſt, by the gradual ſpreading and propagation of the effects of that Diſeaſe, by the ſeveral Ways and Occaſions there mentiond, for almoſt theſe 200 years paſt: which I juſtified by the Teſtimonies of the moſt eminent Authors, who had found it to be ſo by manifold Obſervations in their long Practice. And as I had found it ſo in my own for above twenty years before that time, ſo after ten years time more ſpent ſince in Practiſing, I am ſo confirm'd in every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular which I printed in that Book, that in the future Flux of Time and Experience, when Envy againſt me will be laid to ſleep, thoſe Men that may hap to read it will aſſent to its Truth. But as for the <hi>Four Champions,</hi> I ſay no more than this, I ſhall let their Names die with themſelves; Two of them are gone already; the third (I hear) is often buried in Ale at a place called <hi>The Hole in the Wall;</hi> and the <hi>Fourth</hi> hath asked me pardon before Company, confeſſing that he was ſet on by the <hi>Brotherhood of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:93060:20"/>all other, in Curation of the moſt pertinacious deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſeaſes; of which I have lived to ſee the World, for the moſt part, ſo abundantly convinced, that the more ingenious ſort of Mankind have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that he who is not well-skill'd in the uſe of thoſe Remedies, is not worth the name of a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Inſomuch that the wiſer Sort of the <hi>Oppoſite Party,</hi> when ſome years ago they ſaw the great Men of the Kingdom diſpoſed, and had ſet their hands to an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> for erecting <hi>a new Society of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans upon the Chymical account,</hi> they judged it their only Plea to be made uſe of, to divert that hopeful and moſt neceſſary Intent, to alledge in defence of their <hi>Diana,</hi> that Themſelves were <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> and uſed Chymical Remedies as much as others; arguing thence, that it was needleſs to ſet up any other Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety beſide their own. Whereupon, we may take notice, that being then in a fright, their <hi>allegation</hi> implies, they were glad to confeſs the uſefulneſs of that Way which their Predeceſſors were wont, in the time of my Youth when I firſt came to Practice, exceedingly to decry, and <hi>noted with a black Coal</hi> all thoſe that uſed ſuch Medicins; not ſparing even the Learned and moſt Meritorious Men of the Faculty; ſuch as Sir <hi>Theodore de Mayerne,</hi> who was Martyr'd once before for a <hi>Quack</hi> by the Colledge of <hi>Paris;</hi> and here alſo in <hi>England</hi> I have known ſome would then allow him no better a Title; to whom I may add that moſt worthy Man old Doctor <hi>Rugeley,</hi> and might name divers of like worth; who did no other than what <hi>Greg. Horſtius, Sennertus, Riverius,</hi> and all Men tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Learned and Wiſe have done, and do; that is, join the <hi>Chymick</hi> and <hi>Galenick</hi> Matter of Medicin both together, in their Practice, as they ſee occaſion require: But as for the Doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> and his
<pb facs="tcp:93060:20"/>Way of enquiring into the Vertues of Plants and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, merely by ponderation and preponderation of <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second Qualities,</hi> 'tis vain, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the more excellent way; which is the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of their Natures by the Principles, and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Chymiſts: in which number though I be the leaſt of a thouſand, yet I have a purpoſe to publiſh ſome <hi>Eſſays</hi> of my own, to diſcover what may be done by more able Men, towards an advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Knowledg in the Powers of Plants, in the forementiond way: for, though I have (as I ſaid) been vilely calumniated, yet I think no Man hath at all times, made more conſtant uſe of <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables</hi> in his Practice than I have done, as my Bills at the Apothecaries will ſhew. Some years ago, there was a more ready Opportunity to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliſe me, when my Matter of Medicine being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in my own Houſe, was kept private to my ſelf, and ſo my Adverſaries might maliciouſly ſay of it what they would: Therefore, as ſoon as I found the <hi>Company of Apothecaries</hi> had erected a <hi>Laboratory</hi> at their <hi>Hall,</hi> for ſupply of their Shops with Medicins of all ſorts, of the Chymical Preparation: ſo that a Man might be ſure, upon the Publick Stock and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the <hi>Company,</hi> to be ſerved with them faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared, my Heart roſe with pleaſure to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate them in an Undertaking ſo neceſſary for the Kingdom, it being the Main Matter wherein their Trade was deficient; becauſe what Chymick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins were uſed before to make up the Phyſicians Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, were for the moſt part bought of <hi>private Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators;</hi> of whom we could have no Conſidence for due Preparation, in compariſon of what in reaſon we ought now to have; ſeeing the Security is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Reputation of a Worthy Company of
<pb facs="tcp:93060:21"/>this Honourable City; who cannot well be ſuppoſed to prevaricate for Profit, ſeeing what is done this way is by <hi>Common Conſent,</hi> which being well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, will conduce much more to Profit, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Intereſt, to each particular Man in his Shop, through the ſatisfaction which will ariſe to every Patient, by the benefit which is like to anſwer the expectation of each Family, from thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins rightly prepared. And ſo, from the time that I obſerved this, being to form divers Treatiſes for Publick View, I have caſed my ſelf of the Toil I had taken upon me, and wholly referred Patients with Bills, to receive Medicins diſpenſed by the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Hands. And if I have any thing of worth that is my own Peculiar, or that I have learnt by rolling about to obſerve all ſorts of Practitioners, I freely contribute it in the open way of Practice daily, to ſtop the mouths of lazy, proud, and malicious Men; the greateſt part of which are, in plain Terms, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant even of Literature, or but Smatterers in it, though ſtiff Pretenders, till they hap to be ſifted by a compleat Man of Letters. So farewel.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93060:26"/>
               <p n="2">2. This Thirſt is vitiated chiefly, when it is either <hi>augmented</hi> or depraved; for ſeldom is it <hi>leſſened</hi> or <hi>taken away</hi> with loſs to Man; neither can we believe that Thirſt, or its Cauſe, is truly taken away in certain raving People, with drineſs of Mouth, and burning heat of Body, becauſe they are inſenſible and do not obſerv it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I take <hi>Thirſt augmented</hi> to be deduced for the moſt part from <hi>too ſharp Choler,</hi> carried down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſmall Gut, and there ſo raiſing an effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency with the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> (or Sweet-Breads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> flowing thither, that thence are elevated Salt Vapors, but not bitter to the Ventricle (or Scomach) and Gullet, and there produce a ſenſe of Drought.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Choler being too ſharp, or its Salt Vapors, if they pierce through the Lacteal Veſſels to the Heart, (the like may be ſaid of the ſame Choler carried thither by its paſſage through the Liver) and <hi>infect the Blood too much with its ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> nothing hinders but that the <hi>Spittle</hi> then ſhould turn more or leſs <hi>ſalt</hi> or <hi>ſharp,</hi> which will leſs temper Thirſt, and rather augment it.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               </p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93060:34"/>a great prejudice againſt ſuch-like; which ſomtimes indeed is again at length taken away, ſomtimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to the end of Life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In like manner and more frequently is ſtir'd up in the <hi>Sick,</hi> a Loathing of certain or the moſt Food, and chiefly as often as they are given <hi>hot</hi> or <hi>warm;</hi> for by their ſmell, eaſily ungrateful to the Sick, a quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs almoſt together rais'd, promotes and encreaſes their loathing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Neither are many Sick wont to loath Food of one kind, but ſomtimes of every kind and taſt, and thoſe accuſtom'd and otherwiſe deſir'd; but not Meat only, but alſo often all Drinks, Wine, Beer, and often Water.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Loathing of Food is ſo frequent a Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to the Sick, that ſomtimes it is a manifeſt ſign of unhealthineſs, and eſpecially in Boy's, teſtifying a Sickneſs beginning or begun by that loathing.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is worthy conſideration, that not only Fleſh, and Broths, eſpecially Fat, do loath the Sick, but ſo frequently all things, both <hi>ſweet,</hi> and ſowriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweet; and very ſeldom thoſe things that are more Acid.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And ſomtimes Loathing of certain Meats and Drinks, riſes to that height, and takes away the ſtrength of the Sick, that though the Diſeaſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away for a while, and ſomtimes long, yea, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wholly, yet it continues; whilſt in others quickly, at leaſt in a ſhort while it is taken away or vaniſhes.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But for the moſt part, the Loathing of the Sick depends, 1. of the <hi>vitious Vapors</hi> produc't in the ſmall Gat by a vitious Effervency by <hi>Choler, Phlegm, and the Juice of the Pancreas</hi> vitiated together or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and riſing up to the Ventricle and the Mouth,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93060:34"/>notably diminiſhing Hunger, but more or leſs depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thirſt, and moving chiefly the Smell, or Taſt, commonly alſo Loathing, when mention is made, or at ſight of Victuals.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The ſame alſo do depend, 2. of the trouble that follows the taking of ſuch-like Food, once or ofter, and hence of the wilful prejudice bent of the ſame trouble returning, if they be again taken; whence a Loathing, and hence a Vomiting is wont to be ſtirr'd up in ſome by the memory only of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing or hurtful Victuals.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This Loathing of the Sick is deſervedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to Choler, the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and Phlegm flowing together in the ſmall Gut, and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and therefore vitiouſly raiſing an efferveſcency; ſeeing when they are amended and evacuated, it is taken away and cured forth-with in the moſt.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And as ſomtimes this, ſomtimes that Humor is peccant, ſo alſo the Sick do loath Food of this or that Taſt before others: which when more are nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly peccant together, they are avers to Food of every kind.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And what Humor, and how it is peccant, the conjoin'd Symptoms to be fetch't from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe of other Diſeaſes will ſhew.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Loathing of Healthy People will be Cur'd, by freeing the Mind from every prejudice, or by degrees accuſtoming to the uſe of Food loath'd: which is tri'd ſomtimes in vain, other times with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p n="18">18. After the ſame manner is the <hi>Loathing of the Sick to be Cur'd,</hi> which ariſes from a Prejudice.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe Sick <hi>cannot</hi> ſomtimes <hi>at all,</hi> other times not, unleſs <hi>with difficulty ſwallow</hi> Meat, or Drink, or both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Both the <hi>Tongue</hi> ſerves naturally to <hi>Swallow,</hi> eſpecially by thruſting Meat to the Jaws, and the <hi>Gullet</hi> by thruſting down the ſame, and Drink re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To this end is required both a <hi>movable Tongue,</hi> and the Gullet able to be diſplai'd and folded up, as alſo its Chanel, as well as the upper Orifice of the Ventricle open, and not hindred.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The thruſting of Food forward to the Jaws,</hi> is hindred, as often as the <hi>Tongue</hi> is troubled <hi>with the Palſie,</hi> or <hi>Convulſion,</hi> or <hi>Wound,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> concerning all which we intend to Treat elſwhere.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The thruſting down of Food through the Gullet,</hi> or <hi>ſwallowing</hi> is hindred and <hi>aboliſh'd;</hi> when either 1. the <hi>Throat</hi> is <hi>obſtructed</hi> by a ſolid thing filling its Chanel, to wit, ſomtimes <hi>Fleſh</hi> growing out in that part affected; other times by gluttony, or by ſome <hi>Griſtle, Bone,</hi> or <hi>Kernel,</hi> haſtily ſwallow'd, and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſticking in it. Or, 2. it is <hi>preſt</hi> by a <hi>Tumor</hi> near it, as is wont to be in the Quincie. Or, 3. it is <hi>grown together,</hi> after its <hi>excoriation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Sick <hi>Swallow with difficulty;</hi> 1. When the newly <hi>mention'd hindrances</hi> are only <hi>Light,</hi> and not great, and do only in part ſhut the Chanel of the Throat. 2. When the Throat is troubled with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93060:36"/>the <hi>Palſie,</hi> an <hi>Excoriation</hi> or <hi>Exulceration.</hi> 3. When <hi>Vapors,</hi> or bitter, and tart, or many Belches ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up out of the Stomach, do ſtop and ſomtimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Food that is to be ſwallow'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Somtimes the <hi>Swallowing down</hi> of Food <hi>is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> and <hi>not performed without difficulty and pain,</hi> when the <hi>upper Orifice of the Stomach</hi> is either <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd,</hi> or <hi>Excoriated,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcerated,</hi> or is more or leſs <hi>beſet</hi> with a <hi>fleſhy Excreſcency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Of the moſt Diſeaſes before mention'd, and thoſe that hinder Swallowing down, we intend to ſpeak anon, whence they may be requir'd, which are here deſir'd both to a farther Knowledg and Cure of them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Retention of Food hindred in the Stomach.</head>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. This required Stay and Retention of Food in the Stomach is hindred, when it is expell'd, either <hi>ſuddenly</hi> after it is taken, or <hi>at leaſt ſooner than ought to be,</hi> and that either <hi>upward by the Mouth when Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, or downward through the Guts by Stool,</hi> in the Diſeaſe call'd <hi>Lienteria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Either of theſe diſturbances of Food made down or up, happens uſually by the faultineſs of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> or <hi>its Food,</hi> or <hi>a vitious Humor</hi> provoking the

               <p n="4">4. By fault of the <hi>Stomach</hi> this evil happens, as often as it being inflam'd, or <hi>exulcerated,</hi> or excori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. The ſame falls out by fault of the <hi>Food, or other things Taken together with it,</hi> if they be <hi>ſharp</hi> and provoke the Stomach by biting to unload it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſame happens by fault <hi>of other Humors that were before in the Body,</hi> if they incite the Stomach by <hi>their Acrimony</hi> to a perpetual Loathing, and Vomiting, or to a Contraction tending downward, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a driving down of all things receiv'd in.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Such Humors are often <hi>Chol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. Somtimes <hi>Humors ſowriſh ſalt and ſharp ſlide down from the Head to the Jaws,</hi> and hence to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and compel it to contract it ſelf, and expel what was taken in.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Of an <hi>Inflammation,</hi> and any <hi>Exulceration,</hi> we intend to ſpeak in their proper place.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If this evil happen by <hi>ſharp Food,</hi> more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and alſo aſſwaging things ought to be us'd; or at leaſt <hi>Acrimony is firſt to be temper'd</hi> and corrected.</p>
               <p n="11">11. To this end many <hi>oily things</hi> conduce, <hi>Oil</hi> it ſelf, any <hi>Milk, Cows Sheeps, Goats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fleſh-Broths,</hi> eſpecially Fat; Emulſions prepar'd of ſeveral <hi>Seeds,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Sweet-Almonds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>A ſowr ſharpneſs may be temper'd,</hi> beſides with <hi>ſweet things,</hi> Sugar, Hony, Raiſins of the Sun; and

               <p n="14">14.

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Fermentation of Food in the Ventricle hindred.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat <hi>change which happens according to nature to Food taken into the Stomach,</hi> commonly call'd, <hi>turning of Food into Chyle,</hi> we incline to call <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The chief kinds of this Fermentation of Food hindred, are, 1. when it is <hi>aboliſh't</hi> or diminiſh't; 2. when Increas'd; 3. Deprav'd: which being known, both that which is too ſlowly, and that which is too ſpeedily perform'd, may eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Fermentation of Food is thought to be <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh't,</hi> when, though it be retain'd a ſufficient time in the Stomach, yet is caſt out again <hi>raw</hi> and <hi>unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi> either upward or downward, as it is <hi>Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh't,</hi> when it comes forth a <hi>little, or leſs chang'd than ſhould be:</hi> Whence the Sick get none, or little nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and ſtrength from what they eat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fermentation of Food is ſaid to be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſt,</hi> when it's done <hi>quicker</hi> than ought, whence if Food ſtay longer than its natural and wonted time, it is too much chang'd; that neither ſo can it afford convenient matter to nouriſh the Body; as dough when too much, or too long fermented makes the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93060:38"/>Bread too ſowr, and therefore leſs laudable. For all good conſiſts in a Mediocrity, evil in extreams.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Where it is to be noted, that the Fermentation of Food Encreaſt is not very hurtful to Man, unleſs it perſiſt too long, becauſe moſt commonly Food ſufficiently Fermented, makes no long ſtay in the Stomach, but is forthwith driven forward to the Guts, and there is ſever'd into profitable Chyle and Excrements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But where Fermentation encreaſt perſiſts for a ſpace, there is too much Food deſir'd, and when all ſucceeds well, gradually there follows a <hi>Plethoric, and hence an Athletic Habit,</hi> which, except it be loos'd in time, it's known out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> to whom Experience ſubſcribes, into how great danger it caſts Men.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Fermentation of Food is <hi>Deprav'd,</hi> when it is ſo chang'd in the Stomach, that it affords not a convenient, but hurtful nouriſhment for the Body as well containing as contain'd; whence ariſe infinite evils; ſeeing that the Faults of the firſt Concoction are not corrected eaſily in the ſecond; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways true of a Deprav'd Concoction.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Among the divers kinds of Deprav'd Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Food, two are commonly reckoned the chief, known by the name of Loathſom and <hi>Sowr Crudity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The Fermentation of Food is <hi>Aboliſh't</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh't,</hi> ſomtimes by the fault of <hi>Food,</hi> othertimes of that which Ferments, or becauſe of the <hi>vitious Humors</hi> brought to the Stomach.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It happens by fault of <hi>Food,</hi> when it is taken in either in <hi>too great a quantity,</hi> or does more or leſs hinder or ſtay the Fermentation <hi>by its own vitious quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:93060:39"/>
               <p n="11">11. The vitious quality of Food conſiſts frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its <hi>Fatneſs</hi> abounding; ſomtimes in a <hi>Volatil Spirit</hi> prepoſterouſly, and too much taken, ſomtimes in a <hi>lixiviat Salt,</hi> either <hi>fixt,</hi> or <hi>volatil</hi> too plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo us'd; in one word in thoſe things, <hi>which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently break the Acid Spirit, and its Operation:</hi> whence the thicker parts of Food cannot be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cut and ſeparated from one another; ſo much can a certain proportion and harmony of many things every-where requiſite concurring, do to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effect. Any <hi>Beer</hi> alſo, eſpecially <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> does this if ſwill'd too plentifully, and then it dilutes and waſhes away the Ferment, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms the Meat, hindring it in its Fermentation.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Fermentation of Food is <hi>Diminiſh't</hi> or <hi>Aboliſh't by fault of the Ferment,</hi> both becauſe of its <hi>Defect,</hi> and alſo <hi>Slowneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. The <hi>Ferment</hi> of the Stomach is <hi>Deficient,</hi> when there <hi>is not enough of it</hi> in <hi>the defect of Spittle,</hi> or <hi>in a continual ſpitting;</hi> or <hi>it's carri'd another way, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual drinking,</hi> whereby it is driven forward to the Guts.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This <hi>Ferment</hi> is <hi>ſluggiſh,</hi> becauſe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't <hi>Fatter, more</hi> viſcous, or more watry than it ought, becauſe of <hi>ſuch-like Spittle,</hi> ariſing from <hi>ſuch-like Food</hi> too long us'd; and ſomtimes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't <hi>from the heat of external Air,</hi> or from <hi>a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exerciſe of Body or Mind</hi> ſpending the Animal Spirits; and chiefly where the Animal Spirits are not refreſh't with Food abounding with volatil Spirit, or repair'd being conſum'd and deficient in the Body, ſeeing they are very uſeful to promote the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Food.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Where more Cauſes do concur, the aforeſaid Fermentation or Food is hindred, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:93060:39"/>
               <p n="16">16. Some things may <hi>Diminiſh,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh</hi> the ſame <hi>Fermentation</hi> when they are us'd ill, either for Food or Medicins, and becauſe they <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Ferment,</hi> or render the Food unfit for <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi> are to be eſteem'd <hi>Poiſon;</hi> ſuch as are all, which are endued with an excelling power <hi>of fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. The Fermentation of Food may be <hi>Diminiſh't,</hi> and after that <hi>Aboliſh't,</hi> by the <hi>vitious</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Choleric Humors over-oily,</hi> riſing up to the Ventricle, and either <hi>corrupting or weakning</hi> the <hi>Ferment,</hi> or mixing themſelves <hi>with the Food,</hi> do <hi>trouble, hinder,</hi> or <hi>ſtop</hi> their <hi>Fermentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. On the contrary, the <hi>Fermentation</hi> of Food is <hi>Encreaſt;</hi> either, 1. by the fault <hi>of Ferment</hi> being more <hi>acid and volatil than is wont.</hi> Or, 2. by the fault <hi>of Food</hi> long continu'd, which according to the natural Conſtitution of the Eater, <hi>is eaſily fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Or, 3. becauſe <hi>of the Humors having a volatil acidity, and ſliding down from the Head, or riſing up from the Pancreas to the Stomach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. The <hi>Ferment</hi> and <hi>Spittle,</hi> as alſo <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Humors falling down from the Head,</hi> owe their encreas'd volatil Acidity chiefly <hi>to Food that have in them a volatil acidity,</hi> over-plenteouſly &amp; long taken, and ſuch-like <hi>Sauces,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> or other <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate</hi> and <hi>ſpiritous Drink,</hi> but <hi>ſomwhat acid,</hi> as is <hi>Menſe and Rheniſh-Wine,</hi> us'd for ſome ſpace, though not in too much plenty.</p>
               <p n="20">20. A <hi>careful ſorrow</hi> may in part promote the ſame, but not too grievous; as alſo <hi>clear and ſubtil Air,</hi> but not very hot or cold, but a little inclining to the nature of the Northern.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The Fermentation of Food is <hi>Deprav'd</hi> into a <hi>noiſom Crudity by Choler over-fat and too volatil</hi> riſing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93060:40"/>to the Stomach, and not only hindring Fermentation, but moreover altering and corrupting it. Whence are <hi>Belches</hi> rais'd and lifted up, which diſtend the Stomach, or gnaw it, ſomtimes ſmelling of fri'd Eggs, other-times ſtinking Fiſh, or other things.</p>
               <p n="22">22. But as often as the <hi>Diſtenſion of the Stomach concurs,</hi> or thoſe Belches come up with difficulty, ſo often it is certain that <hi>viſcous Phlegm</hi> is alſo pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>

               <p n="2">2. To this end the Stomach is wont to preſs its Cavity, by contracting it ſelf by its circular Fibres, and expel downwards what is in it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Loathing, Belching, and Vomiting.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IN perfect Health, and a natural State, nothing at all is wont to be driven forward out of the Stomach by the Gullet; ſo that whatſoever riſes that way, gives us a certain ſign of Health weakned, whether it be <hi>Food,</hi> or any other thing aſcends in the form of a <hi>Rifting, Wind, Vapor,</hi> or a more fluid or thick <hi>Liquor,</hi> and is expell'd by the Mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where any thing breaks up in the kind of a <hi>Rift, or a Vapor, with noiſe,</hi> it is properly call'd <hi>a Belch</hi> and that avoided <hi>Belching;</hi> as, where <hi>Food</hi> or any <hi>Humors</hi> are driven forward up out of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, <hi>a Vomit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A Loathing</hi> is wont to precede a Vomiting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and often a Belching, or an inclination leſs or leſs to a vomiting, although that endeavouring to Vomit be ſomtimes in vain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Rifts, becauſe of the toughneſs of their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, do cleave more to the Ventricle, and are more hardly excluded, whence often a <hi>ſwelling of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> and troubleſom diſtenſion accompanies them; which ceaſes, or is eas'd after the Wind is belch't. But <hi>Vapors</hi> and <hi>Rifts</hi> do more eaſily break out of the Stomach, and but ſeldom give a notable <hi>ſound,</hi> but only <hi>an hiſſing,</hi> whilſt <hi>Belches</hi> are often loud enough, and make a ſound more or leſs ſtrong, according to the more or leſs viſcidity of their Matter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Belches</hi> have their riſe, either, 1. from Food it ſelf, or other windy things taken, as <hi>Cheſnuts, Peaſe,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93060:46"/>Beans, Turneps, Radiſhes, &amp;c.</hi> Or, 2. from a Phlegmatic and Viſcous Humor, both cleaving in the Stomach, and rarefi'd into Wind by <hi>Aromatics taken,</hi> and alſo found in the ſmall Gut, and in like manner turn'd into Wind by <hi>Choler,</hi> and driven forward to the Stomach.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That <hi>Choler,</hi> as conſiſting of a volatil and oily Salt, is the <hi>internal efficient Cauſe of Wind,</hi> both every volatil Salt, and eſpecially oily, and alſo every part of Plants fit for diſcuſſing Wind, Seeds chiefly us'd by any that has viſcous Phlegm in the Stomach or Guts, and in the beginning raiſing or encreaſing Wind, and at length diſſipating them, do confirm.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>That the material Cauſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>Vapors,</hi> is a <hi>Phlegmatic</hi> and indeed Viſcous Humor, is manifeſt both by their <hi>Antecedent Cauſes,</hi> ſuch like <hi>Food, Sweet Milk, Fiſhes,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Sea-Fiſh;</hi> the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme parts</hi> of Creatures, as their <hi>Feet,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a viſcous Jelly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo by their <hi>Cure,</hi> by only correcting and educing the Phlegmatic and Viſcous Humor, which is wont to be perform'd ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happily.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Separation of Chyle from the Excrements deprav'd.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AS all Food needs not to be finiſht with uſual Fermentation in the Stomach, to wit, Drink either Watry or Spiritous, or enough fermented before, but chiefly that which is viſcous, and hath its parts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-cloſly connext; ſuch as are moſt Meats, eſpecially ſolid, and among them Bread a little or nothing lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd; ſo the <hi>Parts of Food which are profitable to nouriſh the Body ſomtimes of their own accord, at leaſt more eaſily, other-times more difficultly, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy help of another, do they ſeparate from the reſt of the Parts,</hi> being many, riſing moſt commonly from Meat, <hi>which are again ſent out by Stool,</hi> as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:93060:49"/>to refreſh the Body, after ſome ſtay in the thick Guts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Food therefore being Fermented in the Stomach, and ſent into the Guts, <hi>Choler,</hi> and <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Spittle</hi> alſo conſtantly ſwallow'd, are mixt there for the moſt part four ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth below the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> which Spittle ſtays but a little while in an healthy Stomach, and void of Food, and haſtens ſuddenly to the Guts, and together with the aforeſaid Humors, if I may ſpeak ſafely in <hi>Helmont</hi>'s terms, exerciſes a very notable <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> or three-fold ſway in the <hi>oeconomie</hi> of Man's Body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe three being rightly conſtituted, it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that the <hi>ſeparation of the liquid</hi> and whitiſh <hi>Part</hi> from <hi>the thicker</hi> Part follows this mingling, and gets a divers colour and conſiſtency, according to the diverſity of Food, or Medicins us'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>tender, fluid, and whitiſh Part</hi> we call, by way of excellency, <hi>Chyle,</hi> which goes forward through the ſpungy Cruſt of the Guts, the <hi>Lacteal Veins,</hi> and <hi>Thoracic Paſſage</hi> to the Heart, to get the Form of Blood; whilſt the <hi>thick, ſolid and diverſly colour'd part of Food</hi> is thruſt down to the great Guts, in which it gets the name and form of <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. We give the <hi>priority</hi> to <hi>Choler</hi> in the promotion of this <hi>Separation,</hi> in as much as it mildly <hi>cuts</hi> the <hi>viſcous</hi> parts of Food by its volatil and oily Salt, and <hi>frees</hi> the <hi>Fluid</hi> parts from them, and makes theſe <hi>more fluid,</hi> yea <hi>flowing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. To <hi>Spittle</hi> we aſcribe, that by its promoting the Fermentation of Food more and more, and by diminiſhing the viſcidity thereof, it makes it all more fit for its deſir'd Separation.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:93060:50"/>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, We judg that the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas, by its ſomwhat acid Spirit,</hi> does more potently <hi>looſen</hi> the ſame <hi>obſtinate Viſcidity</hi> of Food, and gives occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo <hi>by compelling</hi> its <hi>moſt viſcous</hi> parts of flowing together with the <hi>more fluid parts,</hi> and preſently <hi>to flow through.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Theſe <hi>three-fold Humors</hi> are requir'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch a benefit to Man's Food being <hi>temper'd</hi> according to their convenient manner, and degree for this Work.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The chief part of which <hi>Choler</hi> conſiſts, is thought by me to be a <hi>lixivial Salt,</hi> temper'd as well by a <hi>volatil Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Oil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. And the chief Part conſtituting the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> ſeems to me to be an <hi>Acid Spirit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd,</hi> eſpecially with a <hi>volatil</hi> Spirit.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Although the moſt part of <hi>Spittle</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly judg'd Water, yet is it not that which chiefly promotes the Separation of <hi>Chyle,</hi> but both the <hi>Acid Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Lixivial Salt temper'd together</hi> in it by a <hi>volatil Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Although I think that more do concur in the making of all theſe afore-nam'd Liquors, yet do I judg that the parts newly mention'd are the chief in performing this preſent Separation.</p>
               <p n="13">13. As often therefore as <hi>one, or two, or all</hi> of theſe <hi>three Humors</hi> are ill-order'd, ſo often <hi>the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chyle from the Excrements</hi> will be <hi>vitious;</hi> which alſo may follow <hi>the fault of Food ill-fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. The ſame <hi>Separation</hi> is accounted to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd; 1. when there is <hi>none,</hi> and although the Food be fermented, and brought to the conſiſtency and form of a Pultis, it is by degrees driven forward whitiſh through the Guts, not colour'd with any
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93060:50"/>yellowneſs of Choler, the Leanneſs of the Univerſal Body concurring, and a notable decay of all the ſtrength, which is in the firſt kind of the Diſeaſe call'd <hi>Caeliac,</hi> which for diſtinction-ſake we call the <hi>Jaundice-like Flux</hi> in the thirteenth Chapter of this Book.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The ſame <hi>Separation</hi> is deprav'd. 2. when it is <hi>more ſparingly</hi> and <hi>Diminiſht,</hi> at leaſt different in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from the now-mention'd kind; wherein the Excrements do indeed keep the conſiſtency of a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, and come forth more or leſs colour'd, the Body alſo pining ſlowly, and its ſtrength languiſhing.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The ſame <hi>Separation</hi> is deprav'd, 3. when that which is <hi>unfit, and therefore hurtful, being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the dreggiſh part of the Food,</hi> goes forward together with <hi>Chyle</hi> to the Blood; which whether any call it <hi>Encreaſt</hi> or <hi>Deprav'd,</hi> I think there is no matter, if it be clear about the thing it ſelf, ſo that thence a convenient Cure may be inſtituted.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The <hi>Separation of Chyle</hi> from the Excrements is <hi>Aboliſht,</hi> either by the fault of <hi>Food</hi> not agreeing with the peculiar Conſtitution of him that takes it in, or otherwiſe <hi>vitiouſly fermented,</hi> or of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors mention'd <hi>Choler,</hi> the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> or <hi>Spittle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Food</hi> that is incongruous or much loath'd, as <hi>it will not eaſily be fermented,</hi> ſo <hi>neither</hi> will it ſuffer it ſelf <hi>to be ſeparated</hi> afterward into uſeful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful parts.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The <hi>beſt Food</hi> alſo, and that which agrees and is moſt grateful to every one, if upon any account whatſoever it <hi>remain crude,</hi> and be not prepar'd to the ſeparation of its parts that ought to be in the Fermentation, then the <hi>Separation of Chyle from its Excrements will be expected in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:93060:51"/>
               <p n="20">20. Although the <hi>moſt volatil and ſpiritous,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>the watry Parts, do perhaps ſeparate of their own accord, from the reſt of the Food fermented as it ought,</hi> and may be ſtrain'd through into the Lacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>(or Milkie)</hi> Veins, yet the <hi>Oily, Saltiſh, Acid, Earthy,</hi> and other parts <hi>alſo uſeful</hi> and neceſſary to <hi>nouriſh</hi> the Body, need a farther and new preparation before they can leave the <hi>over-viſcous, tart,</hi> and other parts <hi>leſs fit</hi> to nouriſh the Body well.</p>
               <p n="21">21. This <hi>Separation will be wanting</hi> as often as the <hi>volatil Salt of Choler</hi> is <hi>ſluggiſh,</hi> or <hi>Choler is not carri'd down to the Guts;</hi> either of which has place in the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> wherein the Excrements uſe to come away whitiſh and not colour'd.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>The Volatil Salt of Choler</hi> is <hi>ſluggiſh,</hi> by reaſon of very <hi>viſcous Food</hi> and alſo fat, yea ſomtimes <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,</hi> and alſo Spirit of Wine; the abuſe whereof the Jaundice, as well as the Aſcites Dropſie common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows.

               <p n="23">23. <hi>Choler is not carri'd down to the Guts,</hi> either when it <hi>is obſtructed, by turning into Stones, or a ſtony Cruſt,</hi> or by viſcous Phlegm in the paſſage thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Guts.</p>
               <p n="24">24. That <hi>Viſcous Phlegm</hi> may be <hi>mixt with Choler,</hi> and cleaving by degrees more and more to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, may at length obſtruct it wholly; or being <hi>carri'd</hi> together with the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas</hi> in the <hi>concourſe</hi> of the <hi>Paſſage of both Choler and the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas,</hi> and ſtop the Out-let of Choler eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs potent to cut it; or <hi>being in the ſmall Gut,</hi> ſtops the ſame Orifice, denying paſſage to Choler.</p>
               <p n="25">25. I cannot think this Separation of Chyle can

               </p>
               <p n="26">26. The <hi>toughneſs</hi> and <hi>ſluggiſhneſs of the Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> as alſo of Spittle is to be requir'd from the over-much and prolong'd uſe of <hi>Viſcous Food,</hi> and chiefly <hi>Sea-Fiſh,</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> not enough bak'd, or leaven'd, or boild, as in Puddings, and other things very <hi>fat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The common <hi>cauſe of Separation</hi> of the Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, from the unuſeful Parts of Food Diminiſht, is <hi>Choler</hi> deſcending over-ſlowly or ſparingly to the ſmall Gut, for the Cauſes newly mention'd, or lighter.</p>
               <p n="28">28. If any ſay thoſe contrary to the aforeſaid are the Cauſes of <hi>Separation Deprav'd or Encreas'd,</hi> he will not eaſily be deceiv'd. For, 1. <hi>Food that moſt agrees</hi> with the Conſtitution of every one, and is more greedily deſir'd before others, will be fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eaſilier, ſooner, and more, and therefore will afford <hi>more of its Chyle than is wont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29. <hi>The ſame,</hi> if they be of a <hi>wholly laudable Juice,</hi> will ſcarce harm the Body, unleſs a <hi>Plethora</hi> and an <hi>Athletic Habit</hi> be thence fear'd.</p>
               <p n="30">30. <hi>The ſame,</hi> if they be of a leſs <hi>laudable Juice,</hi> will eaſily bring on a <hi>Cachexy;</hi> neither will the contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body then be nouriſht conveniently, or the Strength refreſht, which we think conſiſts for the moſt part in the things contain'd. Hence we judg it is, that ſomtimes many both deſire and digeſt much, and leſs laudable Food, and in the mean time by degrees grow lean and defective, or are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chectic.</p>
               <p n="31">31. 2. <hi>Food</hi> that is of an indifferent Nature,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93060:52"/>that is, not leſs containing excrementitious, than nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Parts, and either taken <hi>in a leſs quantity,</hi> or <hi>more ſparingly,</hi> or fermented more potently by the help <hi>of ſome Sauce or Medicin</hi> us'd, will yield its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, and alſo Excrementitious Parts eaſier, and alſo more plentifully, to be ſtrein'd and carri'd through towards the Heart together with Chyle, and hence gives occaſion to vitiate Nouriſhment any way.</p>
               <p n="32">32. 3. <hi>Choler ſharper than natural,</hi> will looſen and receive more of the Food than ought, though well fermented; whence any may ſee that the Chyle will alſo be leſs laudable.</p>
               <p n="33">33. 4. I judg <hi>the Spittle,</hi> or <hi>Phlegm</hi> that riſes from it, or the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas</hi> can produce this evil ſo far, as they abounding with a Volatil Spirit, do more, and ſo too much ferment the Food ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently fermented in the Stomach, whil'ſt it is carri'd through the Guts; and ſo give occaſion to ſeparate uſeful and alſo hurtful parts together with laudable Chyle, and to be carri'd into the Lacteal Veins.</p>
               <p n="34">34. But here is a greater Hurt to be expected, when Choler, or Spittle, or the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> only are peccant; and a leſſer when they are all peccant, becauſe then they almoſt mutually temper them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="35">35. <hi>The Aboliſht Separation of Chyle may be Cur'd,</hi> that riſes by fault of <hi>Food</hi> it ſelf, or <hi>Fermentation,</hi> in their Amendment, of which before.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The ſame ariſing from the <hi>ſluggiſhneſs of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> may be Cur'd, by often uſing a <hi>ſharp Volatil Salt,</hi> prepar'd of whatſoever, as <hi>the ſharp Aromatic Plants, Scurvie Graſs, Creſſes, Muſtard, Horſe-Radiſh,</hi> &amp;c. whereby both the viſcidity of Choler is corrected, and its Acrimonie reſtor'd to the Salt.</p>
               <p n="37">37. The ſame ariſing from <hi>Choler not carri'd down to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93060:52"/>the Guts</hi> may be Cur'd; 1. By <hi>Diſſolving Choler</hi> turn'd into Stones, by the <hi>Juice of Graſs,</hi> and eſpecially by the <hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> that diſſolves any Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. By <hi>cutting Phlegm, obſtructing</hi> the paſſage of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler into the Gut, by what is already mention'd, and any thing elſe before commended, both <hi>Acids,</hi> and alſo <hi>ſuch things as have</hi> a Fixt or Volatil Salt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone or mixt; ſuch as are the <hi>vitriolated Salt of Tartar, Salt Armoniac,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="38">38. The farther uſe of <hi>Viſcous Food</hi> is to be deſiſted from, and inſtead of <hi>Sauce,</hi> uſe often the newly mention'd <hi>Aromaties,</hi> Muſtard, Horſe-Radiſh, and ſuch like, whereby the <hi>over-viſcous Phlegm,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, may by degrees be corrected.</p>
               <p n="39">39. <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> taken for a ſpace at Dinner, or Supper, in Wine, or other Drink, will do the ſame no leſs ſuccesfully, as we have often ſaid.</p>
               <p n="40">40. The <hi>Separation of Chyle Diminiſht may be Cur'd</hi> the ſame way, and by the ſame means, and that eaſier.</p>
               <p n="41">41.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>CHoler and the Juice of the Panereas</hi> do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>flow together into the ſmall Gut,</hi> when the Food fermented is driven forward out of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to the Guts; but <hi>continually,</hi> and ſo alſo at that time are they carri'd thither, when no Food is taken in or carri'd down to the Guts, and <hi>of neceſſity they ſtir up an Efferveſcency in their Concourſe there, for the ſomwhat contrary diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>alth, that is, as long as both is well diſpos'd and temper'd; but <hi>vitious and hurtful</hi> where either, or both of them is intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and over-ſharp.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe that <hi>Phlegm</hi> is always obſerv'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Nature to reſide in the ſmall Gut, and to riſe from <hi>Spittle</hi> continually ſwallow'd down, upon which account the aforeſaid <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> is ſomwhat chang'd: I take it, that in that Conflux of theſe two Humors the <hi>more fluid part of Phlegm</hi> adhering to the ſides of the ſmall Gut is diſſolv'd, and that the ſame being join'd with the moſt part of <hi>Choler,</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93060:53"/>
                  <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas</hi> encreaſing, pierces into the Lacteal Veins to the Heart, whilſt <hi>the tougher</hi> and <hi>more viſcous part</hi> of the ſame <hi>Phlegm,</hi> with ſome part of the other <hi>Humors</hi> alſo <hi>viſcous,</hi> goes by degrees to the thick Gut; and being there mixt with the <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> makes them more viſcous and yellow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>Three-fold Humor</hi> riſing from <hi>Choler, the Juice of the Pancreas, and the Phlegm of Spittle,</hi> and haſting with the <hi>Lympha</hi> to the Heart, ſeems to me <hi>to give the natural Conſiſtency and Coagulation to the Blood;</hi> as I judg the natural <hi>conſiſtency of Blood,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever vitiated, for the moſt part to be attributed <hi>to the ſame three-fold Humor</hi> variouſly <hi>vitiated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore I am perſwaded that the <hi>Efferveſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is rais'd up by this Conflux of theſe three Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, becauſe I do not only judg it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas</hi> is <hi>ſowr,</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Diſeaſes befalling Man unnaturally, but that ſame is moſt abundantly evinc'd by the induſtry <hi>of the moſt ingenious Anatomiſt, (Regnerus de Graaf)</hi> my moſt Beloved Scholar; as is manifeſt by his <hi>Diſſertation of the Nature and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> a year ſince in this Univerſity publickly diſputed, I being Preſident.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is impoſſible that ſuch <hi>Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> which is, <hi>any manner or degree ſowr</hi> ſhould mix with <hi>Choler, abounding with a bitter and volatil Salt,</hi> but preſently an <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> ſhould be rais'd thence, which may be confirm'd with infinite Examples to be had from Chymiſtry and elſewhere.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That this Efferveſcency in time of Health is very mild, is even manifeſt, becauſe it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in healthy People; which notwithſtanding is often ſo manifeſt and hainous in Sick People, that it bewrays it ſelf by Gnawings, Diſtenſions, Gripes,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93060:54"/>Coldneſs, Heat, Belchings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> both in the Region of the Loins, and in the left <hi>Hypochondrium,</hi> and alſo ſomtimes in all the Belly.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Which aforeſaid <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> is many ways vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; 1. Becauſe of <hi>over-ſharp and ſaltiſh-Choler;</hi> whence I am perſwaded that <hi>Thirſt</hi> for the moſt part is Encreaſt, and the <hi>Diarrhea</hi> moſt commonly takes its riſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. 2. Becauſe of <hi>Choler fatter</hi> than natural, whence I take it, that <hi>the Heat in the Region of the Loins</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or beſides in the whole <hi>Body</hi> is produc'd.</p>
               <p n="9">9. 3. Becauſe of the <hi>over-Acidity and Acrimony of the Juice of the Pancreas;</hi> whence other things being alike, I judg that <hi>coldneſs</hi> is ſtirr'd up moſt commonly in the mention'd <hi>Region of the Loins,</hi> and afterward diſtributed into the <hi>whole Body;</hi> which is manifeſt in the <hi>beginning</hi> of almoſt every <hi>Intermitting Feaver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. 4. Becauſe <hi>of the Juice of the Pancreas Tart and harſh,</hi> to which I aſcribe the riſing of ſuch-like Vapors, producing <hi>the Hypochondriac</hi> Suffocation, and alſo <hi>of Pains</hi> wonderfully racking and contorting the Guts.</p>
               <p n="11">11. 5. Becauſe of <hi>over-viſcous Phlegm,</hi> from which ſuch-like Wind is wont to be bred, diſtending the Guts and Ventricle, or more-over other parts, chiefly when <hi>Choler is over-ſharp;</hi> or otherwiſe <hi>the Blood</hi> is made tough and viſcous, known by the name of <hi>Melancholic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Where <hi>Choler</hi> and <hi>the Juice of the Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> are both peccant in <hi>their proper Acrimonie,</hi> moſt grievous pains are ſtirr'd up in the ſmall Gut, and the <hi>Diſeaſe Cholera</hi> or <hi>Dyſenterie,</hi> &amp;c. do often couple them, and almoſt always an <hi>inordinate Feaver;</hi> about all which we intend to ſpeak in their proper place.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:93060:54"/>
               <p n="13">13. Where moreover <hi>Phlegm</hi> is very <hi>viſcous,</hi> or otherwiſe vitious, there the riſe of the <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> Suffocation, or Hypochondriac Melancholy, the Scurvy, Cholic, and other <hi>ſuch-like Diſeaſes</hi> more grievous, daily manifeſts it ſelf now in this or that, and commonly in a changable form.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Of the almoſt <hi>innumerable Diſeaſes</hi> that riſe from the <hi>vitious Efferveſcency of theſe three Humors</hi> flowing together in the ſmall Gut, we may Treat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt through the whole Practice of Phyſick, ſeeing the <hi>moſt</hi> depend on it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. For by this vitiated mingling, not only hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Humors</hi> are produc'd, but often <hi>Wind, Vapors,</hi> or <hi>ill-Rifts,</hi> cauſing much hurt to Man.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Therefore it concerns, that every Phyſician ſhould ſearch out and inquire diligently as, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerns, the Nature and Qualities (both Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Temperate, and alſo Preternatural, and changing from its proper temper, which cauſes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite harm to Man) of theſe three Humors.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Effects and Diſeaſes proceeding from this vitious Efferveſcency are moſt moted and daily, although the reaſon and riſe of them for the moſt part is unknown to us.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Over-ſharp Choler</hi> follows; 1. <hi>Over-ſharp Food,</hi> at leaſt ſauc'd with ſharp and very aromatical things. 2. <hi>Summer-Air,</hi> or <hi>hot,</hi> by any other Cauſe. 3.

               <p n="1">1. AS often as <hi>the Propulſion of what is contain'd in the Guts,</hi> and their <hi>Expulſion</hi> happens <hi>quicker,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>oft'ner,</hi> or <hi>more plentifully</hi> than is wont and ought, ſo often one is ſaid to be troubled with a <hi>Looſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>Looſneſs</hi> is diſtinguiſht into divers ſorts, and ſpecially by reaſon of the different thing <hi>voided.</hi> For, 1. ſomtimes <hi>Food</hi> it ſelf is voided, Meat and Drink, <hi>crude,</hi> and unchang'd, and as they were, if not when taken in at the Mouth, then as ſwallow'd down the Gullet, in the Diſeaſe call'd <hi>Lienteria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. 2. Somtimes the ſame <hi>Food</hi> is ſent out, <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented</hi> and duly chang'd in the Stomach, but <hi>not Separated</hi> in the Guts into <hi>Chyle,</hi> and <hi>Excrements,</hi> but are <hi>Pultis-like</hi> and <hi>whitiſh,</hi> ſuch as thoſe that have the Jaundice do often void; whence I may ſay, and not fooliſhly, that this <hi>Looſneſs</hi> may be call'd,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93060:58"/>a <hi>Looſneſs</hi> belonging to the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> to wit, one kind of the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> call'd <hi>Caeliaca.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. 3. Somtimes <hi>Food</hi> both <hi>fermented,</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd</hi> into <hi>Chyle</hi> and <hi>Excrements,</hi> though <hi>as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd together</hi> are voided, in the other kind of the <hi>Diſeaſe Caeliaca;</hi> which, for diſtinction-ſake, we name the <hi>Chyle-like Looſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. 4. Somtimes not the Food only, but <hi>watriſh and choleric Humors</hi> are often or plentifully voided in a <hi>Diarrhea</hi> or <hi>Choleric Leoſneſs</hi> thence call'd.</p>
               <p n="6">6. 5. Somtimes <hi>Phlegmatic Humors, thick</hi> and <hi>viſcous</hi> are frequently and plentifully voided in a <hi>Phlegmatic Diarrhea</hi> thence call'd; other-times ſmall and <hi>ſerous,</hi> milder or ſharper in the <hi>Serous Looſneſs</hi> thence call'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. 6. Somtimes <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>oily</hi> Excrements are voided, in the <hi>fat</hi> or <hi>unctious Looſneſs</hi> thence to be nam'd.</p>
               <p n="8">8. 7. Somtimes <hi>more pure Blood</hi> is voided in a <hi>Bloody Purging,</hi> to which I think I may refer the <hi>Plux of the Haemorrhoids;</hi> other-times a <hi>Liquor like the waſhing of Fleſh,</hi> in the <hi>Flux</hi> call'd of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>

               <p n="11">11. Seeing that in the <hi>Jaundice-like Flux</hi> the Food is voided enough Fermented, it is manifeſt that it proceeds from <hi>the defect of the Separation of Chyle,</hi> and Excrements, by reaſon of either the <hi>Abſence</hi> or <hi>Sluggiſhneſs of Choler;</hi> of which we have ſpoken in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Seeing that in the <hi>Chyle-like Flux,</hi> Chyle comes come or leſs with the Excrements, the Fermentation of Food, and Separation of Uſeful and Unuſeful Parts being intire, <hi>the ſtraining of Chyle through the Spongie Cruſt of the Guts into the Lacteal Veins will be Hurt;</hi> of which hereafter in <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Seeing that in a <hi>Choleric Diarrhea,</hi> Choleric and Watry Humors, or Serous, are effus'd, then that <hi>Choler</hi> upon the account of its <hi>Salt</hi> is too <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>fluid,</hi> and the <hi>Phlegm</hi> of <hi>Spittle,</hi> or <hi>Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> is too <hi>watry</hi> and alſo <hi>fluid,</hi> is manifeſt as well by what is <hi>voided,</hi> as by <hi>Thirſt</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="14">14. A <hi>Phlegmatic Diarrhea</hi> is <hi>caus'd</hi> primarily by <hi>Viſcous Food,</hi> and ſuch as do breed much Viſcous Phlegm; and ſecondarily, by the <hi>cold and ſharp Air,</hi> both <hi>encreaſing</hi> and <hi>coagulating Phlegm</hi> in the <hi>Blood,</hi> and alſo <hi>Separating</hi> it in the <hi>Brain,</hi> or <hi>Glandules</hi> of the <hi>Brain</hi> againſt Nature; whence ariſe <hi>Phlegmatic Catarrhs,</hi> by which ſliding down to the Jaws, and ſwallow'd down, this <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> is often bred.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Alſo <hi>much Sleep,</hi> a <hi>drowſie reſting of Body, dall Wit, rainy,</hi> or elſe <hi>moiſt Air,</hi> &amp;c. helps much to <hi>heap up Phlegm</hi> in the Body.</p>
               <p n="16">16. A <hi>Serous Diarrhaea</hi> ariſes moſt frequently from <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas Serous,</hi> and alſo <hi>ſuch-like Spittle,</hi> ſeldom from <hi>watry and ſerous Humors,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling

               </p>
               <p n="20">20. A <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>oily,</hi> or <hi>unctuous Looſneſs</hi> almoſt follows the <hi>uſe or abuſe of too fat Food.</hi>

THat which is <hi>contain'd in the Guts</hi> according to Nature, is either <hi>driven forward</hi> into the <hi>Lacteal</hi> Veins, in as much as it is uſeful to nouriſh the Body; or is <hi>expell'd by Stool,</hi> in as much as it is unuſeful to nouriſh it: But againſt Nature the ſame is either <hi>too much excluded</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Stool</hi> with the Humors flowing together in a <hi>looſneſs</hi> thence call'd, of which we ſpoke in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. or in the contracted motion of the Guts inverted, it is <hi>repell'd</hi> upward into the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> and thence <hi>vomited out</hi> in a conſiſtent form, or <hi>exhal'd</hi> or <hi>belch'd</hi> in the form of a Vapor, or Wind; ſomtimes it is <hi>voided</hi> either into <hi>the Cavity of the Belly,</hi> or <hi>out of the Body</hi> by <hi>Wounds or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>leers of the Guts;</hi> of which elſewhere.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:93060:71"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wind</hi> therefore breaks out in <hi>Belches;</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors</hi> in <hi>Yawning,</hi> and the <hi>Hypochondriac Suffocation,</hi> wherein oftentimes <hi>Wind</hi> alſo is rais'd; of which we have in part ſpoken <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. there is no Diſeaſe comes to my mind in which Vapors are obſerv'd to riſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>Vomiting proceeding</hi> from the <hi>Guts,</hi> differs according to the diverſity of what is voided; for ſomtimes Food is repell'd, being firſt driven down to the Guts, other-times Humors carri'd down to the Guts, and voided either ſingle, and pure, Choleric, Phlegmatic, Serous; or Bitter, Sowr, Harſh, Salt, Sweet, Inſipid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Yellow, Green, Ceruleous, Black, White, Watry, &amp; Clear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or variouſly mix'd; one while <hi>Excrements,</hi> other whiles <hi>Blood,</hi> or more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Matter,</hi> or other things riſing from the Guts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The primary Cauſe of all this manifold Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, is the <hi>contracted Motion of the Guts inverted,</hi> and drawing, yea compelling the Stomach to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto, and like change of motion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This <hi>change of Motion begins</hi> frequently from the place where the Paſſage both of <hi>Choler</hi> and the <hi>Pancreas</hi> is inſerted; ſeldom from the Seige; often from this or that part of the ſmall Gut, troubled with a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> or any other grievous Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From the place of the Inſertion of this double Paſſage, the motion of the Guts haps to be inverted, by reaſon of the potent and <hi>violent efferveſcency of ſharp Humors,</hi> then in the Body, or corrupted, or irritated by what is newly taken in.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſharp Humors that are in the Body, are <hi>Choler,</hi> and <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> gone from their natural ſtate, as ſomtimes alſo <hi>Spittle</hi> ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, either <hi>Acid</hi> or <hi>Salt,</hi> and carri'd down to the Guts.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93060:71"/>
               <p n="8">8. The things taken in, that corrupt the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd Humors, and provoke them to raiſe a vitious efferveſcency, are either <hi>Summer-Fruits, Cheries, Plums, Melons, Peaches, Grapes,</hi> &amp;c. alſo <hi>new Wine,</hi> or any ſharp <hi>Medicins,</hi> making either of the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Humors ſharper, as alſo <hi>Vomits;</hi> or <hi>certain Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Arſenic, Orpiment,</hi> &amp;c. whither <hi>corroſive ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim'd Mercury</hi> may, yea, ought to be referr'd, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if it be taken pure, uncorrected, though in the leaſt quantity, it diſturbs and corrupts all.</p>
               <p n="9">9. As often as <hi>Choleric Humors</hi> are voided out, <hi>as well upward as downward,</hi> with great force and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, together with the troubleſom anxieties of the Midrif accompanying, either of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord by Humors before in the Body, or becauſe of an external error committed in Diet; this <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> is wont to be call'd <hi>Cholera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. In the <hi>Hypochondriac Diſeaſe,</hi> and <hi>Suffocation,</hi> and <hi>the Scurvy</hi> it ſelf, there are ſomtimes rais'd, freely Vomitings of various Humors, thinner or thicker; too Viſcous, or Fluid; Bitter, or Acid, or Salt, or Harſh, or Sweet, or Inſipid; Yellow, or Green, or Ceruleous, or Black, or White, or Watry, or Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal-like, or of divers Colours: ſo that all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences occurring in ſeveral, or the ſame Sick People are very difficult to be numbred or reduc'd into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Somtimes <hi>Blood</hi> alſo is by force poured out by <hi>Vomit;</hi> Which I ſuſpect, if not always, at leaſt moſt commonly, comes out of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> by reaſon of ſome <hi>Veſſel open'd by its over-ſharp Juice;</hi> and it is driven up to the Stomach, to be vomited out, there being then alſo a vitious Efferveſcency with Choler; whilſt for the moſt part ſome of it deſcends down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be voided by Stool.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:93060:72"/>
               <p n="12">12. I Cur'd the Widow of a Mariner about 20 years ſince at <hi>Cullen,</hi> fallen through great grief of Mind, contracted by her Husbands Death, if my memory fail me not, into a grievous and daily <hi>Pain of the Loins,</hi> and hence into a ſpontaneous <hi>Vomiting,</hi> and <hi>Dejection of Matter,</hi> left for incurable by Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans call'd to ſee her, yet reſtor'd by degrees with the help of Sugar'd Wine, warm'd and taken by turns: And ſeven years after by a grievous ſorrow of Mind brought into ſuch a like vehement Pain of the Loins. I therefore gueſſing, by the relation of her former Diſeaſe, that <hi>Matter</hi> lay hid in the part griev'd by a former <hi>Inflammation</hi> produc'd and collected, gave her twice an <hi>Antimonial Vomit,</hi> and, if I remember right, my <hi>Sapa Vomitoria;</hi> by the help whereof ſhe vomited the firſt day more than a pint, or ℥ xx. of Matter well ripen'd, and by Stool a good quantity of the ſame; alſo by the benefit of the Vomit iterated, one or two days being interpos'd, ſhe empti'd again ſome Matter upward and downward, though leſs than before, and was reſtor'd to perfect health, in a ſhort while, ſome few Cordial Medicins, and ſuch as reſiſt Putrefaction being given.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I judg that <hi>Matter</hi> therefore procedes out of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> becauſe the place affected anſwer'd its Situation; and becauſe I have often found Matter collected in greater or leſs plenty in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, but not in any other part, from which there was a way to the Guts.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ne reaſon makes me conjecture and think, that the <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>iting of Blood</hi> is not to be deduc'd from the <hi>Spleen,</hi> of <hi>Liver,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Menſenterie,</hi> but from the <hi>Pancreas</hi> alone, ſaving the judgment or obſervation of others.</p>
               <p n="15">15. When <hi>the contracted Metion of the Guts begins
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93060:72"/>to be inverted</hi> from the Siege, then I judg <hi>an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſharp Humor</hi> adhers to it, ſeeing it is wont to be Cur'd with <hi>ſuch as only aſſwage and temper ſharp things.</hi> For I never had ſuch a Patient to Cure, that I could make an exact examination of all his Symptoms, and hence give a ſolid Judgment of every one.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Often <hi>its contracted Motion begins to be inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this or that part of the ſmall Gut,</hi> with the <hi>Vomiting up of the Excrements</hi> following, from the <hi>Gut</hi> affected, call'd by Phyſicians <hi>Ileos,</hi> and <hi>Ileos</hi> by Practitioners.</p>
               <p n="17">17. I have obſerv'd in Diſſecting dead Bodies, a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this Evil, the one was a <hi>Gangrene of the Gut,</hi> ſuch a wrinkling and preſſure together of the corrupted Gut accompanying it, that all paſſage downward was deni'd the Excrements, and were forc'd to a miſerable return upward, and ſo an egreſs by Vomiting.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The other <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this evil noted after Death in the Dead by me, was the entrance of the ſmall Gut, in any part ſtraitned, into the next part, which was more opened by wonted Wind: Whence likewiſe all paſſage through, for the Excrements by Siege was ſtopt, and anon their regreſs and aſcent to the Stomach follow'd, with a miſerable Vomiting of them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. I judg'd that Ingreſs of the ſmall Gut into the next part, happen'd after the aforeſaid manner, and indeed one while of the upper part into the next inferiour, other-whiles of the inferior into the upper part; becauſe I had often obſerv'd, 1. That the ſmall Gut was in many places diſtended with Wind, and moſt narrowly contracted for a notable length in the next parts, as well upper as lower. 2. That the ſame Sick being preſs'd with Gripes, wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93060:73"/>mov'd their Body, and often bow'd it on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And by that bowing often repeated, it might hap, that Wind preſt farther by reaſon of the Gut relaxed in either end, ſhould yield to the oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme part of the Gut as yet ſtraitned, to inſinuate it ſelf into the Cavity of the Gut ſufficiently enough diſplai'd, a ſtraitneſs preſently ſucceeding of the ſame Gut freed by Wind, driven forward violent enough about the next part inſinuated.</p>
               <p n="20">20. As often as the under part of the Gut enters into the upper, ſo often there is hope of Cure, either of its own accord by Food taken in, or by Art, by Lead or Golden Pills ſwallow'd; but not ſo, when the upper part of the Gut enters into the under, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the part included goes on by degrees farther, whence the narrowneſs is more and more encreas'd, and all deſcent of what is contain'd is ſtopt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity, and ſurely Death is thence to be expected.</p>
               <p n="21">21. There is alſo frequent mention among Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners <hi>of the Gut writh'd and wrap'd together,</hi> no Example whereof, after diligent ſearch, I could find, and now ſcarce think it can be, that the ſmall Guts ſhould be ſo intricately complicated, as it were, with a Knot.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The Rupture of the Guts is a frequent <hi>Cauſe</hi> in Practice, <hi>of the voiding Excrements by Vomit,</hi> yet not every one, but ſuch and ſo great ones, that <hi>the ſmall and alſo thick Guts</hi> falling out <hi>through a narrow hole,</hi> either by reaſon of their proper weight, or for what is contain'd therein perpetually approaching, and remaining there, <hi>cannot be put back through the ſame Hole,</hi> nor afford a paſſage downward, <hi>to what is contain'd ſliding thither;</hi> whence the things contain'd being more and more hardned, and ſuch as ſomtimes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93060:73"/>cannot be diſſolv'd, breed an hard and unſuperable Tumor; and moreover hindring alſo the reflux of Blood, give occaſion to an <hi>Inflammation</hi> and <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> of the Guts ſoon following, and hence <hi>to vomit th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Excrements out at the Mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. All theſe Evils are often encreas'd or bred by <hi>Fomentations</hi> evilly and too hot appli'd; as alſo by a prepoſterous and ſtrong <hi>rubbing</hi> of the ſwell'd part: Laſtly, By <hi>Violence</hi> us'd to the ſwell'd Guts to repel them.</p>
               <p n="24">24. The <hi>Cure</hi> of this <hi>manifold Vomiting</hi> may be perform d diverſly, according to the <hi>variety</hi> of each Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="25">25. As often therefore as the Irritation of the Guts depends on the <hi>vitious Efferveſcency of ſharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors flowing together,</hi> to the inverſion of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Motion, ſo often theſe <hi>over-ſharp Humors</hi> are to be <hi>corrected</hi> and <hi>temper'd,</hi> yea, <hi>ſtupefi'd</hi> together with their <hi>Efferveſcency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26. The Medicins that <hi>temper</hi> both <hi>Choleric Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,</hi> and <hi>thoſe of the Pancreas too ſharp,</hi> are often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd before; to which <hi>Opiats</hi> alſo often nam'd are always to be added <hi>to aſſwage the vitious Efferveſcency,</hi> and <hi>ſtupefie the ſenſe of the Guts</hi> at leaſt in part.</p>

               <p n="28">28. When this Vomiting is ſtai'd, if the aforeſaid Humors ſeem to <hi>abound,</hi> after they are ſufficiently temper'd, they may be <hi>empti'd out</hi> and <hi>diminiſht by

If <hi>the Vomiting cannot be ſtaid by reaſon of plentiful Humors in the Body, endeavouring an Out-let upward ſtrongly,</hi> nothing hinders but that a <hi>gentle Vomit</hi> may be given; moreover adding thoſe things which alſo <hi>temper, allay,</hi> and <hi>vanquiſh</hi> their <hi>too great Efferveſcency</hi> after a certain manner, and ſo neceſſity urging, <hi>Opiats</hi> themſelves in a ſmall quantity.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the Continual and Vital Efferveſcency of Blood in the Right Ventricle of the Heart hurt.</head>
               <p n="1">1. CHyle is not only carri'd to the Right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart, ſome hours after the Food is taken in, whereby it may be chang'd into Blood, but <hi>continually by the Blood returning from every Part;</hi> and that partly being <hi>furniſh'd with bitter Gall,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>having Acid Lympha, there is rais'd in the ſame place a mild,</hi> yea, Vital <hi>Efferveſcency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We call it a <hi>Lively Efferveſcency</hi> that is rais'd in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, becauſe <hi>the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Preſervation of our Life depends upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For by the Conflux of the Volatil Oily Salt ruling in the Gall,</hi> and conſtituting the chief part of the <hi>Sowriſh Sweet Spirit;</hi> of theſe, I ſay, being <hi>ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what contrary,</hi> there is rais'd <hi>a gentle,</hi> and to Nature friendly <hi>Fight,</hi> deſcrib'd by Us with the Name of an <hi>Efferveſceney,</hi> in and by which the <hi>Fiery Parts</hi> lying hid, and ſhut up in both are loos'd from their Fetters, and being free'd, infinuate themſelves into the <hi>Oily</hi> and <hi>Fat</hi> obvious Parts, both of the <hi>Blood,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Chyle,</hi> as the proper Subject of their Action, <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refying</hi> the ſame; and moreover do ſo <hi>change</hi> and <hi>alter</hi> the other parts more or leſs mixt with them, that <hi>Life may be continu'd,</hi> and <hi>Blood mov'd any whither;</hi> and the neceſſary <hi>Reparation</hi> of all the <hi>containing</hi> and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93060:83"/>
                  <hi>contain'd</hi> Parts, perpetually more or leſs Conſum'd, may be <hi>perfected</hi> and <hi>abſolv'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It haps that this <hi>Efferveſcency,</hi> very neceſſary for Life and Nouriſhment, is Hurt; 1. When it is either <hi>wholly Aboliſht,</hi> or <hi>Ceaſes</hi> at leaſt <hi>for a time.</hi> 2. When it is Diminiſht, and is Leſſer or Weaker. 3. When it is <hi>Encreas'd,</hi> and is Greater or more Potent. 4. When it is <hi>Haſtned,</hi> and is too Swift. 5. When it is <hi>Retarded</hi> and perform'd too Slowly. 6. When it is <hi>Deprav'd</hi> and obſerv'd to be Unequal or Inordinate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I. Where this Vital Efferveſcency is wholly Aboliſht, <hi>Death</hi> is at hand; becauſe the Vital Fire of the Heart, or rather of the Blood, which by its help us'd to be continu'd in the Heart, is preſently extinguiſh'd by the ſame.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This Vital Efferveſcency is Aboliſht. 1. By the fault of the <hi>Choleric Blood Aſcending,</hi> and that either for <hi>Want of Choler:</hi> as oft as it is effus'd with great force into the Small Gut, and hence Choler is excluded out of the Body, as well upward by Vomit, as downward by Stool, in the Diſeaſe <hi>Cholera;</hi> whence no wonder if the Sick periſh ſomtimes then in a few hours.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Or becauſe of the <hi>high Volatility and Acrimony of Choler,</hi> whence the <hi>Blood</hi> is not only more <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,</hi> but the <hi>Lympha</hi> alſo <hi>more ſluggiſh;</hi> as we judg it happens in the <hi>Peſt,</hi> and all <hi>Malign Feavers,</hi> in which the Sick ſo oft are ſuddenly and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly extinguiſh'd.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The ſame Vital Eſſerveſcency is Aboliſht, 2. By the fault of the <hi>Lymphatic Blood Deſcending,</hi> which is by reaſon of the <hi>over Acidity of Lympha,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Choler</hi> is not only oppreſt and, as it were, ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Heart, and together with Choler <hi>the Veſtal
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93060:84"/>and Vital Fire;</hi> or the <hi>Blood it ſelf extreamly coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi> is made unfit for its naturally following Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We ſcarce ever think that ſuch a <hi>Defect</hi> can be thought of <hi>Lympha,</hi> for which the Vital Efferveſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may be <hi>Aboliſht,</hi> unleſs perhaps the <hi>Paſſage of the Thorax</hi> be ſomwhat <hi>Preſt, Wounded,</hi> or <hi>Burſt,</hi> and therefore the <hi>greateſt part Standing ſtill,</hi> or <hi>Run out</hi> another way. Neither ſeems it probable that <hi>all the Conglobated Glandules,</hi> from which we judg the Acidity of the <hi>Lympha</hi> procedes, can be ſo <hi>affected alone,</hi> that therefore the <hi>Acid Lympha ſhould be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the Heart.</hi> For as often as <hi>the Body is congeal'd with Cold, the extreme Parts</hi> are not leſs, but more ſeiz'd on by it, than the <hi>internal Glandules that lie hid;</hi> in which beſides the <hi>Lympha</hi> is not ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd, as <hi>corrupted by Cold,</hi> although then its <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be both alter'd</hi> and <hi>diſturb'd;</hi> as we obſerve it falls out in the Stuffing of the Head, in which all Motion of a Humor both to the Noſtrils, and alſo to the Jaws, <hi>is Stopt</hi> firſt with an Heavineſs of the Head; (whence the name <hi>Gravedo</hi>) afterward the Humor <hi>Diſtills more plenteouſly,</hi> and often thinner and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than is wont; to wit, Sowriſh Salt, and then this Diſeaſe is properly call'd either <hi>Coryza,</hi> whilſt it runs out by the Noſtrils, or <hi>Bronchos,</hi> whilſt it is carri'd down to the Jaws and begets an Hoarſneſs; as a <hi>Cough,</hi> when it ſlides down farther into the Sharp Arterie of the Lungs, and provokes and compels them to a more mov'd and violent Expiration.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The ſame Vital Efferveſcency is Aboliſh'd; 3. By <hi>too many Vapors rais'd in the moſt vehement Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency,</hi> and ſo employing all the ſpace in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, and hence in the Veſſels of the Lungs, that the Fire then alſo breaking out, is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93060:84"/>choak'd by them, and extinguiſh'd, otherwiſe it had been Vital; neither is there further place granted to the new Efferveſcency preſently following.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Vital Efferveſcency is Aboliſh'd by too many Vapors in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, not only in as much as the ſpace in the Veſſels of the Lungs is deni'd to new Blood that ſhould raiſe an Efferveſcency, and conſequently undergo a Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but alſo in as much as the Lungs being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſtended by the aforeſaid Vapors, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be farther unfolded, nor reciprocally complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor yet Reſpiration very neceſſary to temper the Heat of Blood can be perfected.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But the ſame is yet aboliſh'd. 4. By <hi>too much Blood</hi> filling all the <hi>Veſſels, Veins and Arteries, in the Plethora,</hi> call'd <hi>at or in the Veſſels,</hi> and <hi>Athletic Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> and that for want of Space to receive the Blood, although meanly to be Rarefi'd, after a due Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The ſame Vital Efferveſcency is Aboliſh'd. 5. By the <hi>over-potent Vital Fire</hi> rais'd in the Heart, <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refying the Blood</hi> more than enough, and to an <hi>Height;</hi> whence by the defect either of a Space large enough, in which it may be receiv'd, or ſufficient Cooling, whereby the hot Blood might be temper'd, our Vital Fire is often Suffocated in the <hi>moſt Burning Fevers</hi> by its own fault.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The <hi>Efferveſcency of Blood</hi> ſomtimes <hi>Ceaſes</hi> in the Right Ventricle of the Heart <hi>for a time,</hi> not only ſhort, but often very notable; to wit, for one or two days, the Pulſe and Reſpiration to be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, taken away to outward Senſe, as is always in the moſt grievous kind of <hi>Hypochondriac Suffocation,</hi> and the <hi>Syncope,</hi> and alſo ſomtimes in a lighter kind of the aforeſaid <hi>Suffocation,</hi> and <hi>Swouning Fits,</hi> join'd
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93060:85"/>with the Pulſe ſtopt to Senſe, ſuch as is frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in theſe Regions.</p>
               <p n="15">15. For we muſt not paſs it by, <hi>that the Pulſe and Reſpiration are not always taken away to Senſe in every Hypochondriac Suffocation, or lighter Swouning Fits; although they be perpetually more or leſs hinder'd or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd,</hi> ſeeing the Voice it ſelf and Speech ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are more or leſs hinder'd.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The chief <hi>Cauſe of this Efferveſcency, Ceaſing for a notable time,</hi> is <hi>viſcous</hi> and alſo <hi>Acid Phlegm, not too much exceeding in plenty</hi> (otherwiſe it would be Aboliſh'd with Death following) <hi>join'd to the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> and hence <hi>to the Deſcending Blood,</hi> and <hi>carri'd to the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>The Cauſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>Efferveſcency Ceaſing a ſhort while,</hi> about a quarter, half, or a whole hour is judg'd by me to be <hi>a Viſcous alſo and Acid Vapor,</hi> or <hi>Wind-piercing</hi> out of the <hi>Small Gut</hi> through the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteal Veins and Paſſage of the <hi>Thorax to the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. For as this Viſcouſly-Acid Phlegm is more plenteous or ſolid, or more conſiſtent, or leſs in quantity, or more Vaporous; ſo it will hinder our Vital Efferveſcency more, or longer, or leſs, or ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter while, and ſeem to take it away at leaſt to Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senſe; ſeeing it may deſervedly be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed and actually it be taken, or may be taken away without the Patient's Death: the ſolution and determination of which Doubt, will depend on the Prejudice or Opinion of every one given about the following Queſtion; to wit, <hi>Whether Life can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main without a continual and new Suſtentation and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Vital Fire? Or whether the ſame could be extinguiſh'd for a while, and again be kindled and reſtor'd in the Heart of its own accord, or by help of Medicins, before that a deadly Corruption poſſeſs the Blood, and the other Humors.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:93060:85"/>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Our Vital Fire</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>kindled and reſtor'd in the Heart of its own accord,</hi> when <hi>Acid and Viſcous Phlegm</hi> being join'd in too much plenty with the Deſcending Blood, doth ſo oppreſs <hi>Choler</hi> coming with the Aſcending Blood, that for a ſpace there is no power of it obſerv'd, till by the help of this ſame Choler, the aforeſaid Phlegm being reduc'd and brought back by degrees to ſome mediocrity, a new Fire riſes up and reſtores Life to the Body, perhaps taken away for a time.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>By the help of Medicins, our Vital Fire</hi> may be ſaid <hi>to be kindled and reſtor'd,</hi> when in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd Diſeaſes, one or two Drops of ſome <hi>very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatic Oil,</hi> with a little Aromatic Spirit of Wine, or any other convenient Liquor, once or often pour'd into the Mouth of the Sick, who is in the Agonie of Death, pierce to the Blood infected, and worſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the aforeſaid Viſcouſly-Acid Phlegm, may raiſe, or ſtir up ſuddenly, or by degrees, the Vital Fire it ſelf, languiſhing or extinct, <hi>by correcting or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Phlegm, and alſo ſtrengthning and relieving Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. But an ingenious Searcher of Truth may que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether <hi>ſuch an Aromatic Oil,</hi> fitly call'd <hi>Balſam of Life,</hi> or any other like it, (whoſe ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious force in ſuch a caſe is not unknown, as well to them that are Expert in the Art of Chymiſtry, as Skilful in the Practice of Phyſick) <hi>be join'd to the Blood, almoſt condenſt to Death by Phlegm Viſcouſly-Acid in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. As much as I am able to attain by the beſt of my Underſtanding, that I may ſtudy to ſatisfie this Queſtion, ſaving to every Man his particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I judg it no wiſe abſurd, to think that <hi>this
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93060:86"/>Conjunction of the Aromatic, and then truly Vital Oil with Phlegm, Viſcouſly-Acid, too much thickning Blood happens in the Veſſels of the Lungs;</hi> ſeeing that nothing offers to hinder, that ſome part of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick Blood may be driven forward into the Arterie of the Lungs, before either the Pulſe or Reſpiration be taken away to Senſe. This being aſſerted, it will not be difficult to explain, how the ſtrength of the Aromatic and Vital Oil ſhould pierce eaſily to the Right Ventricle of the Heart, as I conjectur'd, then more or leſs open'd, and alſo by the Blood it ſelf not leſs coagulated in the Arterie of the Lungs, then too much in the aforeſaid Ventricle, and therefore leſs fluid.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Theſe things being inſerted, as it were, by a Parentheſis to incite Wits; note, that the wonted Efferveſcency, and hence the Rarefaction of both ſorts of Blood flowing together to the right Ear of the Heart, and therefore both the reciprocal Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Contraction of the Heart, and the Pulſe it ſelf is more or leſs hindred and ſtopt by both the mention'd Cauſes, to wit, Phlegm, and a Vapor Viſcouſly Acid; which is obſerv'd therefore not to be in the <hi>Syncope,</hi> and certain kinds of Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac Suffocation, hitherto to be reduc'd altogether to Swounings.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Among the ſix <hi>Non-natural Things, an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected grievous Sorrow of Mind,</hi> or <hi>Terror,</hi> and ſomtimes the <hi>biting Cold of Air or Water,</hi> makes that Ceſſation of the Vital Efferveſcency ſomtimes, and oftner in Perſons diſpos'd to it, becauſe of the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous and Flatulent alſo, and Acid Humors now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Body, in Women eſpecially, and others of a more fearful Nature.</p>
               <p n="25">25. II. This <hi>Efferveſcency of the Blood</hi> Deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93060:86"/>and Aſcending to the Heart, is <hi>Diminiſh'd,</hi> and ſo becoms <hi>Leſs</hi> or <hi>Weaker,</hi> by the fault of either the <hi>Choleric</hi> or <hi>Lymphatic</hi> Blood.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Of the <hi>Choleric,</hi> when Choler is <hi>not ſharp enough,</hi> or is <hi>too little</hi> in the Aſcending Blood.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>Choler</hi> is produced in the Body <hi>not ſharp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;</hi> 1. Becauſe of the over-cold and moiſt <hi>Air.</hi> 2.

               <p n="28">28. <hi>Choler</hi> is found <hi>too little</hi> in the Aſcending Blood for the ſame Cauſes newly mention'd, and chiefly by a <hi>Choleric Looſneſs,</hi> or <hi>over-great emptyings of Choler</hi> wrong done, whence the natural quantity of Choler is diminiſh'd.</p>
               <p n="29">29. By the fault of the <hi>Lymphatic Blood</hi> the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Efferveſcency is <hi>Diminiſh'd,</hi> when the <hi>Lympha of the Glandules</hi> in the Blood is <hi>not Sowr enough,</hi> or <hi>too Little,</hi> or <hi>over-Viſcous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30. This <hi>Lympha</hi> is found in the Blood <hi>not Sowr enough.</hi> 1. Becauſe of Hot or Rainy <hi>Air.</hi> 2.

               <p n="32">32. The <hi>Lympha</hi> is <hi>too Viſcous</hi> in the Blood. 1. By ſuch-like <hi>Food</hi> long us'd. 2. By the Cold and Sharp <hi>Air.</hi> 3. By a grievous and long-continuing Sorrow of Mind.</p>
               <p n="33">33. III. The ſame Efferveſcency of both ſorts of Blood flowing together in the Heart is <hi>Encreas'd,</hi> and becoms <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>more Potent</hi> by the fault of <hi>either,</hi> or of <hi>both</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34. Of the <hi>Choleric,</hi> when <hi>Choler</hi> is too <hi>Sharp</hi> or <hi>Plenteous</hi> in the Blood Aſcending.</p>

               <p n="41">41. Let it ſuffice that we have here noted <hi>Choler may</hi> abound by an inward Cauſe; that is, be provok'd and compell'd to pour it ſelf out of its Bag, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93060:87"/>as ſome <hi>of a Volatil Acid Liquor</hi> pierces thither to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Blood, and <hi>forces Choler to raiſe an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency;</hi> whence no wonder, if it runs out at any Paſſage given, and now being carri'd to the Guts, ſtirs up <hi>Vomitings,</hi> or <hi>Choleric Looſneſſes,</hi> or being carri'd to the Liver, and thence ruſhing to the Heart, breeds <hi>Burning Fevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="42">42. The Vital Efferveſcency in the Heart is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd <hi>by the fault of the Lymphatic Blood,</hi> when the <hi>Lympha</hi> is not ſo Plenteous, as <hi>Volatil</hi> and <hi>Sharp,</hi> though <hi>too Little</hi> flowing to the Heart with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Blood.</p>
               <p n="43">43.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And whilſt <hi>the Blood</hi> goes <hi>through the Lungs,</hi> it is mildly <hi>temperd</hi> in its <hi>Heat</hi> and warmneſs, and more or leſs <hi>condenſd</hi> by the <hi>Air ſuck'd in,</hi> leſt the newly kindled Vital Fire in the Heart and Blood ſhould be Suffocated by over-plenteous Vapors raiſd up by too much heat.</p>

               <p n="4">4. I. There is <hi>No Motion of Blood through the Lungs.</hi> 1.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the Alteration of Blood by Air Inſpired, and Expired Deprav'd.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe moſt do judg that <hi>Reſpiration</hi> was ordaind <hi>to temper the heat of Blood,</hi> over-heated by the Efferveſcency newly deſcrib'd in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, becauſe a more evident <hi>Heat</hi> is obſervd in the Univerſal Body, and eſpecially in the Heart of thoſe living Creatures that have Lungs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a double Ventricle in the Heart; which that it is allayd and temperd by the Air Inſpired, is evident by inconveniences following the Air that is leſs fit to moderate it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As I do not deny that this is, ſo I judg the Air inſpired does chiefly conduce again to <hi>condenſe the Blood much rarefi d</hi> in the Right Ventricle of the Heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But how, or after what manner and way the Inſpired Air alters the Blood to both theſe ends, is not ſo manifeſt. I think it is, in as much as the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and ſomwhat Acid parts are diſperſt in the Air,</hi> that are able to condenſe the hot and rarefi'd Blood, and mildly lay its heat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I diſtinguiſh between the Somwhat-acid and Nitrous parts of the Air; ſeeing that the <hi>more or leſs Acid</hi> is more ſimple, and the <hi>Nitrous</hi> more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, to wit, of <hi>Acids,</hi> but not any, but ſuch as are alſo <hi>Oily,</hi> joind with a <hi>lixiviat Salt;</hi> which the artificial, that is, Chymical Solution and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Nitre makes manifeſt.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:93060:101"/>
               <p n="5">5. That manifold parts flie <hi>in the Air,</hi> not only <hi>Watry, Fiery,</hi> and <hi>Earthy,</hi> but alſo <hi>Oily, Spiritous, Lixiviat and Acid Salts,</hi> divers ways more or leſs mixt with all of theſe, the many Experiments not unknown to ſedulous Searchers of Chymical Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges do evince, although moſt abſtruſe to Lazy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Philoſophers every-where, and pratling Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villers; which ſomtimes, if the Matter require, we intend to publiſh, for their ſakes who are good and addicted to one Truth, with many others out of our own Obſervations, as yet unpubliſhed, by the bleſſing of God, plenteous enough, though our Adverſaries ſnarle at it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This <hi>Tempering</hi> to be made in the Lungs no leſs uſeful, than neceſſary by Air Inſpired is <hi>Deprav'd,</hi> either when there is <hi>None,</hi> or <hi>too Little,</hi> or ſomtimes <hi>too Much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. There is <hi>no Tempering of the Blood, when very hot and quiet Air is the cauſe;</hi> whence a Man often fals into a <hi>grievous Swouning,</hi> or <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf; The Blood being highly rarefi'd and fluid, and therefore overwhelming and ſuffocating its internal Fire, for want of the newly mentiond Nitrous or Acid parts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Blood</hi> is <hi>more ſparingly temperd</hi> by the Air Inſpired, with the ſame Cauſe but lighter, when the <hi>Sowr</hi> and <hi>Nitrous Parts</hi> are <hi>fewer</hi> or <hi>more ſluggiſh;</hi> at leaſt <hi>fewer are ſuckt in by Inſpiration,</hi> than were deſired to temper equally the preſent and urging heat, and rarefaction of Blood.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Fewer Parts of Acid or Nitrous Air are drawn in,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Inſpiration</hi> it ſelf <hi>hindred,</hi> which is to be explaind in the next following Chapter.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The <hi>Nitrous</hi> or <hi>Acid</hi> parts <hi>are too Few</hi> or <hi>Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh</hi> in the Air by very great <hi>Heat</hi> or <hi>Moiſture</hi> in it; a Sign whereof moreover, if not alſo a Cauſe, is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a great Calm of Air.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93060:102"/>
               <p n="11">11. The Oily parts of the Air rarefie potently, but the Salt and Sowr are allayd and become too ſluggiſh by the Beams of the Sun, both Fiery and Spiritous, the moſt frequent cauſe of the hot Air; as being diſſolvd by watry or rainy Moiſture, they are weakned; whence no wonder if ſuch being ſuckd in, are leſs fit to temper the heat of the Blood.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The uſe of <hi>Bellows</hi> ſo very uſeful in modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the heat of the Air by a mild agitation, evinceth the <hi>quiet Air</hi> to be leſs fit to <hi>temper the Blood,</hi> than when it is but a little mov'd.</p>
               <p n="13">13. As it is evident that Cold is produc'd by any Wind, or by the motion of the Bellows from the Senſe of Cold in the external parts receiving the Air ſo mov'd; which I judg is partly by the diſcuſſion of the Fiery Parts collected about us, the heat of the Air urging, and therefore producing a greater heat in us; partly by the bringing together and gathering of the Nitrous and Acid Parts, firſt either broken, or driven away every whither and remov'd from each other by the fiery Parts; at leaſt by more plenty and efficacy of thoſe fiery leſs perceived by Senſe.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The Blood carrid through the Lungs, is <hi>too much Temperd,</hi> that is, <hi>Condenſd and Coold</hi> by the Air Inſpir'd, when the <hi>Nitrous</hi> or <hi>Acid parts abound in the Air,</hi> by which often eſpecially in the Winter-Seaſon, the North Wind blowing, and in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons near the cold Zone, and chiefly when the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Body was firſt too hot, then <hi>Blood is ſo coagulated</hi> in the Lungs, that it begets an <hi>Obſtruction</hi> in its Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or middle windings of the Lungs; whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows always a <hi>Stoppage of Blood</hi> it ſelf, and ſomtimes a <hi>Burſting of the Veſſels</hi> by their <hi>Diſtenſion,</hi> and an <hi>Effuſion of Blood,</hi> together with a <hi>Peripneumonie</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſd by the Blood continually flowing to it; and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93060:102"/>after the Apoſteme is opend, a <hi>Conſumption</hi> of the Lungs call'd <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> and afterward for the moſt part <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. The <hi>Tempering of Blood</hi> in the Lungs <hi>Aboliſht and Diminiſht, may be Cur'd,</hi> by changing the very <hi>Hot Air</hi> with <hi>Cold,</hi> whether <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Artificial.</hi> For ſuch Air Caves and Cellars under ground, not ſeldom Nitrous are wont to contain. Such do we make by Art by diluting Nitre, or Salt Armoniac in Water, and preſently pouring it out on the Chamber-floor; or by ſprinkling ſharp Vinegar alone, or mixt in like manner with Water; or in like manner caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſowriſh Plants, or their Leaves and Flowers in the Chambers, by the help of all which we encreaſe Sowr and Nitrous Parts in the Air.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The great <hi>Calm of Air</hi> by the Winds quite laid is artificially to be <hi>ſtird by Bellows,</hi> or any other way <hi>ſtirring up the Wind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. The <hi>moiſture of Cloudy Air</hi> is corrected, by making <hi>a clear</hi> fire with Wood.</p>

               <p n="19">19. The <hi>too great Condenſation,</hi> and <hi>Cooling of Blood</hi> carri'd through the Lungs, <hi>may be Cur'd,</hi> by changing the over-ſharp and cold Air, for hotter and more calm; and by kindling in a fit Chamber, Fires great enough; and by uſing Medicins that allay the Nitrous and Acid parts of Air admitted.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the Inſpiration of Air Deprav'd.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE ſaid in the former Chapter, that the Air was both Inſpir'd, and alſo Expir'd mildly to condenſe, and cool the Blood waxing hot out of the Right Ventricle of the Heart, and driven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through the Lungs to the Left Ventricle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Inſpiration of Air</hi> happens, as often as at the expanding of the Midrif downward, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the Thorax upward, the Lungs adjoind to both are together dilated; as we judg we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it abundantly in many things in Our Eighth Phyſical Diſputation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſame Inſpiration of Air is Deprav'd; 1. When it <hi>Ceaſes,</hi> or <hi>is Aboliſht.</hi> 2. When it is <hi>not ſufficient,</hi> and therefore is <hi>too Frequent.</hi> 3. When it is with pain and <hi>Difficulty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I. The <hi>Inſpiration of Air</hi> is ſaid by me to <hi>Ceaſe,</hi> when there is no need thereof; which happens both in the <hi>Syncope,</hi> and in ſome kinds of <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac Suffocation;</hi> in which a Man ſomtimes may want all Reſpiration, at leaſt manifeſt to Senſe for a notable time, (to wit, whole dayes without the change of Life with Death) of which only true Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are wont to ſpeak, judging by what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd by Senſe, yielding the Imaginary Reſpiration to imagining Doctors.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But then there is no neceſſity of Inſpired Air, becauſe there is no notable Burning of Blood raiſd in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, there happening no notable Rarefaction of the ſame; wherefore the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93060:103"/>Blood having no heat there needs no Tempering, its deſired Rarefaction no condenſing; but the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Heart are not very much expanded, or otherwiſe provok'd to contract it ſelf in ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; whence <hi>the Pulſe</hi> then is <hi>Deficient</hi> to Senſe of neceſſity. Of which ſee alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſame <hi>Inſpiration of Air</hi> is ſaid by me to be <hi>Aboliſht;</hi> when <hi>its need of being inſpir'd doth urge,</hi> there being a notable Efferveſcency and Rarefaction of Blood in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, the Pulſe remaining great and ſtrong enough, though for a ſhort ſpace, <hi>yet the Inſpiration it ſelf Ceaſes, and is ſuddenly taken away,</hi> in the forementiond <hi>Suffocation</hi> or <hi>Strangulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The Inſpiration of Air ſo neceſſary to Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of motion is <hi>Aboliſht,</hi> either by the fault of the <hi>Thorax</hi> and <hi>Midrif,</hi> or of the <hi>Lungs</hi> and <hi>Waies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. I think that Inſpiration <hi>cannot be Aboliſht</hi> by the fault of the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> or <hi>Midrif alone,</hi> although when <hi>both are deficient together</hi> in their <hi>Motion,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders but that it may be.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They are <hi>Deficient</hi> together in their <hi>Motion,</hi> when all the parts are deſtitute of the Animal Spirits, and hence of Senſe and Motion in the moſt grievous <hi>Apoplexie,</hi> whence Death ſuccedes certainly and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Inſpiration of Air may be Aboliſht <hi>by the fault of the Lungs,</hi> when the <hi>ſharp Arterie</hi> is ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after any extreme manner.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

               </p>
               <p n="13">13. 1.

               <p n="6">6. Or <hi>Dry,</hi> when nothing is ſpit out, though with great and much labour, but the Univerſal Body is weari'd in vain with endeavouring to <hi>Cough;</hi> whence there is ſomtimes raiſd a vehement <hi>Pain</hi> both of the <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Hypochondries,</hi> and <hi>of other Parts,</hi> yea, ſomtimes a <hi>Rupture</hi> is bred by it, ſomtimes the <hi>Urine</hi> or <hi>Excrements are unvoluntarily extruded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. 3. The ſame Expiration is deprav'd in an <hi>Hicket,</hi> in which the Region of the Stomach is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd to be ſuddenly and violently driven forward, and outward, that <hi>Motion</hi> truly <hi>Convulſive,</hi> ſoon cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and again often repeting, and ſo then the moſt troubleſome and grievous Symptom to the Sick.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I judg the <hi>Midrif</hi> is affected in an <hi>Hicket</hi> in that part of its Motion, wherewith it <hi>ſerves for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration;</hi> and in which it is perceivd (by Touching no leſs than Seeing in the opend Belly of Brutes
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93060:109"/>ſtill living) to be contracted with a force great enough towards the Region of the Stomach.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Wherefore I judg the <hi>Hicket</hi> to be the proper <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of the <hi>Midrif,</hi> and in no wiſe of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, ſeeing that beſides what is already ſaid, it may be <hi>Voluntary,</hi> and can be ſtird up by Me, and others at any time as we pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yet will I not deny that the Midrif is for the moſt part drawn into conſent to make an <hi>Hicket</hi> by the Stomach firſt affected, and eſpecially by <hi>Sharp Vapors, or Wind, or Humors,</hi> whenceſoever procede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and piercing what way ſoever to the Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Centre of the Midrif, and provoking it by <hi>pricking,</hi> or <hi>corroding,</hi> to perform that Convulſive Motion.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Therefore I judg the <hi>true Cauſe of the Hicket</hi> to be, whatſoever is apt to compel the Midrif to a violent, but not continu'd, and preſently interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ceaſing, and again often a repeating Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it ſelf; whether it be found in the Stomach, (to which hurtful and ſharp Medicins or Food, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be call'd Poiſon, are to be referrd) or the ſame riſe up out of the ſmall Gut by the Vitious Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency of the Humors meeting raiſd in the form of an Humor, Vapor, or Wind, and ſo affect the upper Orifice of the Stomach, eſpecially by corroding, that the Midrif encompaſſing it is alſo affected; or the ſame being ſhut up in the Cavity of the Thorax, or Belly immediately frets the Midrif, or is carri'd to it through its Veſſels, and ſticking in its Subſtance, corrodes its ſenſible parts, or compells it any other way, to that troubleſome, and convulſive, ſolitary, and moreover continually repeating contraction of it ſelf.</p>

               <p n="13">13. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of a <hi>Cough</hi> is, whatſoever can pull the Sharp Arterie of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> or any way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and moleſt it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And indeed the <hi>Cauſe of a Moiſt Cough</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd to be manifold; for ſomtimes certain <hi>things coming from without,</hi> or <hi>taken in at the Mouth,</hi> and being wrong carri'd into the Sharp Arterie, do ſoon raiſe a troubleſome <hi>Cough:</hi> At other-times the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors</hi> (and for the moſt part <hi>Phlegmatic</hi> of ſeveral kinds, either Sharp, and Salt, or Sowr; or Mild, and Inſipid; other-whiles thin and fluid, or thick and viſcous; ſomtimes <hi>Blood</hi> pure, or mixt with other Humors; and ſomtimes <hi>Purulent Matter</hi>) <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down from the Head,</hi> and piercing into the ſame

               <p n="15">15. As often as Blood coming out of the Lungs is ſent forth with a Cough, ſo often this Diſeaſe is call'd a <hi>Spitting of Blood,</hi> and <hi>Haemoptoic Paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. A <hi>Dry Cough</hi> has for its <hi>External Cauſes,</hi> both <hi>cold Air,</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> receivd largely, and troubling the Sharp Arterie: but for <hi>Internals,</hi> ſomtimes a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>viſcous</hi> or very <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>ſharp Catarrh,</hi> ſcarce yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Air that is vehemently expir'd; ſomtimes <hi>Vapors</hi> or <hi>Wind</hi> elevated from the ſmall Gut, and Ventricle, through the <hi>Gullet,</hi> and ſuckt into the Lungs together with the Air; or inſinuating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ſame Gut, through the Lacteal Veins, into the Heart &amp; Veſſels of the Lungs; yea, their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, even to the Sharp Arterie, and provoking it continually to Cough without excluding it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>The manifold Diſeaſes</hi> noted in <hi>Expiration De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd, may be Cur'd;</hi> 1. <hi>By taking away, or correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their External Cauſe.</hi> 2.

               <p n="18">18. And that we may begin at the <hi>Hicket,</hi> as often as <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>ſharp Food, or Medicins,</hi> or rather <hi>Poiſon</hi> are in the Stomach, unleſs they can be <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perd</hi> and <hi>corrected</hi> by thoſe that <hi>Alter,</hi> they are to be <hi>Expelld,</hi> either by a <hi>Vomit</hi> upward the ſhorter way, or by a <hi>Purge</hi> downward the longer way; which is alſo to be underſtood of any Humors found in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93060:111"/>or Small Gut, and cauſing, the Hicket.</p>
               <p n="19">19. We have often before propoſd Medicins that <hi>Alter</hi> and <hi>Correct</hi> the Humors, as alſo any thing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in what way ſoever peccant, ſo that it ſeems not neceſſary to repete them here again; we only admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you this one thing, That <hi>Opiats</hi> do conduce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other things in curing any Hicket; not only in as much as they temper any ſharp Humors, but moreover in as much as they blunt the Senſe of the Stomach, and perhaps alſo make the Animal Spirits more ſlow of Motion; if they be us'd by times in a ſmall quantity, and ſo long, till the Hicket either cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or is notably diminiſht.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Among <hi>Vomits,</hi> I here prefer <hi>Antimonials</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others, both becauſe they do moſt happily empty any Humors promiſcuouſly, and becauſe they are moſt friendly to Mans Nature, by degrees bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Humors in Man after a peculiar manner, to a moſt laudable ſtate; which power I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in other things likewiſe, but know it is in Antimonie; whatſoever Men blinded with their Prejudices prate to the contrary, both otherwiſe Learned and Unlearned.</p>
               <p n="21">21. But beware leſt they be together taken in too great quantity, ſeeing indeed <hi>every Exceſs is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Nature;</hi> and it is always ſafer that they be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a leſs than in a greater Doſe, for no harm will at any time follow the firſt, though often the latter: for (notwithſtanding the Opinion of many Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as well as Unskilful Phyſicians) neither do other Purgers, and eſpecially Antimonials rightly prepar'd, and us'd in a leſs quantity, and emptying no Humor upward or downward hurt any, which I having very many times experienc'd do teſtifie; but they always then are profitable, either by amending
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93060:111"/>the hurtful Humors in the Body, or by preparing them farther for the following Purge; which I would chiefly have noted by Younger Phyſicians, for whoſe ſakes this my little Treatiſe is publiſhd, and not for the Elder, who are verſt in the Works of Art, and therefore need not my Information; much leſs for the obſtinate, rejecting any thing of an other Mans by Prejudice or Envy, and no leſs unskilfully, than wickedly carping at them.</p>
               <p n="22">22. When therefore after <hi>Narcoties</hi> are firſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently us'd, a Vomit has been taken, and little or nothing is caſt out upward or downward; and the Hicket ſtill urges, and ſigns of the Humors remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Stomach, or next Gut, raiſing this Evil do remain, then you may ſafely give the Sick a new Vomit either the ſame day, and then in leſs quantity, or another in the next in a ſomwhat greater quantity, whereby the peccant Humors will be more corrected, or expelld upward or downward, or both ways: For ſo the truly Rational and Dogmatic Cure of the Hicket will be moſt ſafely, and no wiſe unpleaſantly, and ſoon enough abſolvd: chiefly leaning on Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and hence Sound Reaſon, not Weak or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious, and ſo falſe.</p>
               <p n="23">23. If the Vitious Humors be voided by the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit taken, and the Sick be weari'd by vomiting, an Aromatical Mixture may conduce, as being moſt convenient to diſſipate the moleſting Vapors ſticking about the Stomach, together with <hi>Opiats</hi> added in a ſmall quantity, and the moſt apt to aſſwage the ſtirrd up too potent Efferveſcency of Choler, and and the Juice of the Pancreas by Vomiting, and to procure Sleep mildly, and to ſtay the Hicket more. For Example;</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:93060:112"/>
               <p>℞. <hi>Mint-Water</hi> ℥ ii. <hi>Matthiolus his Aqua Vitae, or Simple Treacle-Water</hi> ℥ ſs. <hi>Confection of Alker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>

               <p>Let the Sick often take a Spoonful of this Mixture, till he find his Body diſpos'd to Sleep; which that he may the ſooner take, let him lie down commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
               <p n="24">24. To this Mixture may be added <hi>Sp. of Nitre</hi> ſix or eight drops, as often as <hi>Wind</hi> alſo moleſts, which often happens.</p>
               <p n="25">25. If the Sick do leſs incline to Vomit, and be not troubled with Loathing, it is better that the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors peccant be Empti'd downward,</hi> and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Variety, ſomtimes with <hi>Cholagogues,</hi> other-times with <hi>Phlegmagogues,</hi> or <hi>Hydragogues</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or at other-times with ſeveral of theſe mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as the Matter requires, as is ſet down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And becauſe all <hi>Obſtinat Diſeaſes</hi> have their riſing from <hi>over-Viſcous Humors,</hi> at leaſt acknowledg them to be conjoind to their Cauſe, therefore in an <hi>Obſtinat Hicket,</hi> the Medicins that both cut and educe viſcous Humors are not to be neglected.

               <p n="28">28. <hi>Sneezing,</hi> which takes its riſing from Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſes, is ſoon wont to ceaſe when thoſe are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, or ſhund: But that which acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Internal Cauſes, both ſliding down from the Brain, and riſing up from the nether parts, <hi>may be Cur'd,</hi> both by <hi>Correcting the Sowrly-Salt Humors in the Stuffing of the Head,</hi> and <hi>Viſcous Phlegmatic Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors</hi> for the moſt part joind with them, both by <hi>Oily</hi> and <hi>Spiritous Aromatics;</hi> and by <hi>Educing</hi> them, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Stool,</hi> by <hi>Hydragogues</hi> and <hi>Phlegmagogues;</hi> partly through the <hi>Noſtrils</hi> or <hi>Mouth</hi> by <hi>mild Snee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> or Maſticatories, and by <hi>Correcting</hi> the <hi>Humors</hi> that raiſe a vitious <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> in the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and chiefly in the <hi>ſmall Gut,</hi> and <hi>driving ſharp Vapors</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>to the Noſtrils,</hi> by the forementiond <hi>Spiritous</hi> and <hi>Oily Medicins,</hi> not neglecting or omitting <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats;</hi> and by <hi>Educing</hi> the ſame down ward rather than upward if they abound, by Medicins often propos'd.

               <p n="39">39. When by the proper Diſeaſe of the Lungs, Blood pure, or corrupted into Matter, is voided by Coughing, there is greater danger, wherefore we muſt haſten the more to its Cure, leſt the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here, if any where urgent, be loſt by delay; for the ſingular Subſtance of the Lungs is eaſily infected and corrupted, but difficultly reſtor'd and repaird.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Therefore muſt we not ceaſe from the uſe of Medicins that cure the efflux (and corruption) of Blood burſt out of the Veſſels of the Lungs, till the evil be wholly taken away: Yea, I adviſe, that a ſparing uſe of mild Medicins ſhould be continu'd for ſome time after the Diſeaſe is cur'd to ſenſe, whereby the part once affected may be ſtrengthned againſt the acceſs of a new evil, and therefore eaſily again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p n="41">41. As in other Caſes always, ſo here you muſt diligently attend to the Medicins that moſt conduce to every particular Body, whereby they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd before the reſt, and as long as they profit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93060:114"/>in the uſe thereof: And as ſoon as ever they are obſervd to profit leſs, ſubſtitute others in their room; and ſo the Health of the Sick is to be promoted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way.</p>

               <p n="43">43. Let me therefore here admoniſh you in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that the Breath held as long as may be, and ſo alſo the Cough being hindred by force, will not a little conduce to allay and mitigate any Cough, and eſpecially a Dry one; by which means I have often obſervd, both in my ſelf and others, that a Cough otherwiſe troubleſome enough, has been wholly taken away or diminiſht; as in like manner I have often noted the <hi>Hicket</hi> alſo ſo Cur'd.</p>

               <p n="1">1. HItherto I have thought with others that own the Circular Motion of Blood, that the Blood is not only alterd by the Air Inſpir'd, but moreover that it <hi>is driven forward out of the Right Ventricle of the Heart into the Lungs to be nouriſht by it:</hi> Whence as the Lungs alone receive this Blood, ſo I thought they alone were nouriſht by it, until laſt year an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> ariſing from the Deſcending Trunc of the Great Artery, was diſcoverd by the Obſervation of the moſt diligent Anatomiſt, and famous Embalmer of Bodies, Dr. <hi>Frederic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uyſch,</hi> a Phyſician at the <hi>Hague,</hi> containing in a public Diſcourſe, <hi>An Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Valvul's in the Lymphatic and Lacteal Veſſels, and ſome rare Anatomic Obſervations;</hi> and, becauſe it accompanies the widenings of the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, call'd by him <hi>Bronchialis;</hi> and, as it carries the Blood elaborated and perfected in the Left Ventricle of the Heart to the Lungs, it is aſſign'd by him for their Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But although, when I came to Print this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it happend opportunely that there was a Body
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93060:115"/>of a Youth who periſht with Cold, to be Cut in the public Hoſpital; and I ſought diligently the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it aforeſaid by the mentiond Treatiſe, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs; yet would I not therefore herein miſtruſt ſo famous a Man, but rather lament, that a few days after I was hindred againſt all right by ſome through prepoſterous ſpite leſs addicted to the Common Good, and oft hurful, whereby I could not Diſſect the Body of a Youth dead of Difficult Breathing, and ſearch out the ſecond time the forenam'd Artery, to demonſtrate i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in public for the ſake of many Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents earneſtly deſiring to know this thing by ocular Inſpiction; eſpecially ſeeing that the ſame Dr. <hi>Ruyſeb</hi> had in one word ſhewn me the way to obſerve it more certainly, and had alſo told to others that the ſame thing had happend more than once which had happend to me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether therefore the Lungs receive their nouriſhing Blood by this <hi>Bronchial Artery,</hi> or toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by that of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> as oft as by reaſon of the Efferveſcency of the Blood Aſcending and Deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vitiated in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, the Blood riſing from both is vitious, the <hi>Nouriſhment of the Lungs will be deprav'd,</hi> and that ſooner, more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, and potently than any other part of the Body, if they be nouriſht in part, at leaſt by the Blood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Right Ventricle of the Heart, being leſs temperd than the other effus'd out of the left Bed of the Heart, and more or leſs temperd in them by the Air Inſpir'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Nouriſhment of the Lungs is Deprav'd;</hi> 1. When it is <hi>Diminiſht</hi> or <hi>Aboliſht,</hi> and they pine more or leſs. 2. When it is <hi>Ill-nouriſht,</hi> and the Lungs get a Subſtance and Conſiſtency harder, or more compact than is naturally, or on the contrary
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93060:116"/>ſofter, or more flaccid, or alſo unequal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For 3. I ſcarce think, and that very ſeldom, that the Nouriſhment of the Lungs may be <hi>Encreaſd,</hi> if we ſpeak properly, as long as their Subſtance is lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Lungs Pine</hi> more or leſs, ſomtimes in both <hi>ſides,</hi> ſomtimes in either, and in this or that <hi>Lobe,</hi> by the fault of either <hi>It ſelf,</hi> or the <hi>Blood,</hi> or <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. IT is known by the Circular Motion of Blood, that Blood is driven forward to the parts of the Univerſal Body, and ſo to the Lungs, (of which we have ſpoken in the preceding Chapter) out of the Left Ventricle of the Heart: Whence it is not undeſervedly askt, <hi>Wherein differs each Blood effus'd out of each Ventricle of the Heart?</hi> To which I Anſwer, It differs in this, That, 1. <hi>the Blood of the Left Ventricle gets a new Alteration in the Lungs by the Air Inſpir'd;</hi> And perhaps, 2. <hi>ſomthing may come to the ſame Blood, either from Spittle, or from another Glandulous Liquor</hi> moiſtning the ſharp Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and mixing it ſelf with the Blood together with the Air, and ſo far alſo <hi>after a certain manner Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Tempering it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And I plainly doubt whether moreover any thing elſe happen to the Blood in the Left Ventricle of the Heart; nor hitherto do's any notable Sign of it come into my Mind whence I may conclude it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore I can at preſent only aſſert this, That the Blood going through the Artery and Vein of the Lungs, and perhaps the middle ſubſtance of the Lungs comes out of the Left Ventricle of the Heart temperd, leſs hot and rarefi'd, and ſo more mild than out of the Right, both by the Inſpired Air or Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or any other Glandulous Liquor; and that its <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> ſeems to me to conſiſt in this, That <hi>its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold

               <p n="4">4. Therefore this <hi>Perfection of Blood is Deprav'd,</hi> chiefly, when the ſame Blood <hi>is too little or too much Temperd,</hi> or alſo <hi>is too much Kindled,</hi> and <hi>Rarefi'd,</hi> or otherwiſe <hi>Corrupted</hi> by the <hi>Air Inſpir'd,</hi> or the <hi>Humors of the Body</hi> communicated to it with the ſame: Of which ſee what is ſaid in <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Blood may be corrupted by the Inſpir'd Air,</hi> when it is <hi>much defil'd</hi> by any <hi>Wind,</hi> or <hi>Exhalations</hi> whenceſoever proceding and mixt with it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates its harm to the Blood carri'd through the Lungs; whence the ſame harm divers ways infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Maſs, or its greater or leſs part by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees is ſomtimes diſperſt every way, other-times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to one part chiefly, and manifeſts the force of its malignity in it; as we have known it in the <hi>Peſt,</hi> and other <hi>Epidemic Diſeaſes for the moſt part depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Air ill-affected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. This Perfection of Blood is alſo deprav'd by the <hi>Humors</hi> mixt with it Aſcending or Deſcending, either <hi>Choler,</hi> or <hi>Lympha, or the Liquor ariſing from that Three-fold Sway</hi> in the Guts, or alſo <hi>Chyle</hi> ſo far exceeding in an ill quality, that <hi>it cannot again be Temperd</hi> Conveniently or Sufficiently by the Inſpird Air.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Of the Motion of the Heart and Arteries, or the Pulſe Deprav'd.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe <hi>ſides</hi> of the <hi>Ventricles of the Heart are</hi> by little and little <hi>Diſtended,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfolded</hi> by the <hi>Blood</hi> driven forward into them out of the Veins, and its Earlets, and that partly in <hi>Plenty,</hi> partly and chiefly by the <hi>Rarefaction filling</hi> them again becauſe of the Efferveſcency of it, till the ſame Blood be pour'd out by their following <hi>Straitneſs</hi> into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries annext to them; which therefore are <hi>Laid open,</hi> as a little after <hi>Bound together,</hi> and that <hi>by a Motion</hi> ſomtimes manifeſt to <hi>Feeling</hi> and <hi>Sight,</hi> which is known among Phyſicians by the name of the <hi>Pulſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For by the <hi>Pulſe</hi> the Phyſicians underſtand the two-fold oppoſite, and contrary, yea reciprocal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Expanſion, and Contraction in the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold parts mentiond according to its Sides or Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: And the Motion of Dilatation and Straitning according to the Cavity of the Ventricles of the Heart and Arteries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We think <hi>the Right Ventricle of the Heart is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93060:120"/>Diſplaid,</hi> both by the <hi>Plenty of the Blood driven in,</hi> and by the <hi>Largeneſs</hi> of it ſoon <hi>Rarefying</hi> by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency; and <hi>the Left Ventricle</hi> by the <hi>Plenty</hi> of the <hi>over-hot</hi> and as yet boiling <hi>Blood,</hi> howſoever more or leſs temperd in the Lungs by the Air Inſpir'd: and <hi>Both Ventricles are Straitned</hi> by the <hi>muſculous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Heart,</hi> contorted wonderfully like a writhd Shell <hi>contracted by the Animal Spirits filling its Fibres,</hi> after the manner of the other Muſcles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We alſo judge <hi>the Arteries are Diſplaid</hi> by the <hi>Blood Expelld by the Contraction</hi> of the Heart into Them; and the ſame are again <hi>Straitned</hi> by <hi>the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits filling</hi> their <hi>annular Fibres,</hi> and <hi>Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their Cavity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Pulſe is felt</hi> by Phyſicians, not ſo much in the Heart it ſelf, as <hi>in the Arteries,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>in both Wriſts,</hi> where they are more manifeſt to the Senſe of Touching: Although the Pulſe of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries may be obſervd alſo about the <hi>Temples,</hi> and moreover at the <hi>Neck;</hi> as <hi>the Motion of the Heart,</hi> by laying the hand on its Region, chiefly when its <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation</hi> urges, that cannot be enough diſtinctly known by the Pulſation of the Arteries, or when a little or no Pulſe is felt in the Wriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Primary Differences of the Pulſe</hi> felt in the Wriſt may be reduc'd to <hi>three chief Heads,</hi> the <hi>Strength, Greatneſs and Frequency of the Pulſe.</hi> For the <hi>Swiftneſs</hi> aſcrib'd to the Pulſe, may indeed be conceivd by the Mind, but not toucht and felt with the Fingers: And <hi>Hardneſs</hi> is but ſeldom found in the Pulſe, and always in a Praeternatural State; when as thoſe aforementiond are obſervd both in a Natural and Non natural Pulſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Pulſe</hi> is call'd <hi>Strong,</hi> when the Artery ſmites forcibly the Fingers of him that Touches; but
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93060:120"/>
                  <hi>Weak,</hi> when it happens only gently and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Pulſe</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Great,</hi> when the Artery is unfolded much, and with a large ſpace; but <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> when little and in a narrow ſpace.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The <hi>Pulſe</hi> is call'd <hi>Frequent,</hi> when the expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſmiting of the Arterie is obſervd in the ſame ſpace of Time ofter, then otherwiſe, or in others; and <hi>Rare,</hi> when it is leſs oft, then is wont, or ought to be.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The <hi>Pulſe</hi> is call'd <hi>Moderat,</hi> or <hi>Mean,</hi> which is the middle between the extrem's of the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Differences.</p>
               <p n="11">11. A <hi>Strong,</hi> or <hi>Potent,</hi> and <hi>Valid</hi> Pulſe is cauſd by the <hi>Animal Spirits plenteouſly carri'd</hi> to the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Subſtance of the Heart <hi>ſtrongly</hi> contracting it; whence it is never preternatural upon its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, yet ſomtimes upon the account of the Cauſe provoking.</p>
               <p n="12">12. A <hi>Weak Pulſe</hi> oft follows a <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Defect of the Animal Spirits</hi> in the Univerſal Body, at leaſt <hi>partly</hi> in the Heart it ſelf; ſomtimes a <hi>Sluggiſhneſs and Drowſineſs,</hi> or Unmovableneſs of the Univerſal Body.</p>

               <p n="8">8. For when <hi>a Diarian Fever</hi> is rais'd, <hi>by the alone Heat of Air,</hi> to be aſcrib'd either to the Sun, or Fire, or Bath, no Shivering is obſerv'd, but <hi>Heat alone,</hi> and that by degrees more and more <hi>encreaſd</hi> in the Body, till at length being made Preternatural, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>the preſence of a Fever,</hi> not only <hi>by the Pulſe greater and more frequent</hi> then is wont, but alſo <hi>by the Pain and Pulſation of the Head,</hi> and ſuch like Symptoms anon to be recited.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If <hi>Cold</hi> of Air, or any other thing <hi>come upon the Body hot,</hi> what way ſoever, whence a Diarian Fever is raiſd, <hi>a light Shivering</hi> will precede <hi>the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93060:128"/>greater Heat</hi> ſoon after following; and then in the beginning indeed <hi>the Pulſe</hi> will be <hi>little,</hi> but anon <hi>greater,</hi> and conjoind to both <hi>more frequent,</hi> other <hi>Symptoms</hi> alſo happening.</p>
               <p n="10">10. So when <hi>a Diarian Fever</hi> is raiſd by <hi>ſtrong,</hi> that is, <hi>very Spiritous,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Aromatic Drink</hi> taken in too much quantity, a Shivering will ſcarce ever precede the Heat continually encreaſd, and at length made Preternatural and Feveriſh, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt by <hi>a greater and more frequent Pulſe,</hi> but <hi>by a Heat</hi> moreover troubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>a Diarian Fever,</hi> is bred <hi>by an over-agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, wearineſs,</hi> and <hi>more vehement Motion, the Pulſe</hi> is obſervd, not only <hi>more frequent,</hi> but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>weak,</hi> beſide a <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>troubleſom wearineſs of the whole Body.</hi>

But when <hi>a Diarian Fever</hi> is caus'd by the <hi>Paſſions</hi> or <hi>Motions of the Mind,</hi> it owns <hi>Anger</hi> for its Cauſe, and then <hi>the Pulſe</hi> is not only <hi>more frequent</hi> and <hi>greater,</hi> but moreover <hi>unequal and troubled;</hi> as, when it is bred by <hi>a ſudden Sorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p n="13">13. When <hi>a Diarian Fever</hi> ariſes <hi>from Watchings prolongd,</hi> and <hi>Cares, a Frequent, Little and Weak Pulſe</hi> is wont to be a preſent Companion, <hi>with a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Heat of Body,</hi> and <hi>Pain of the Head,</hi> carrying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it <hi>the Senſe,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>of Weight,</hi> other-times <hi>of being Void,</hi> or <hi>of Emptineſs.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX</hi> Of Synochal, commonly call'd Containing Fevers.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Fevers</hi> that ſome call <hi>Putrid,</hi> to diſtinguiſh Diarian and Synochal Fevers not putrid, ſo call'd by them, of which we have treated in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter; the moſt diſtinguiſh into <hi>Continual</hi> and <hi>Intermitting Fevers;</hi> as again them into <hi>Containing,</hi> or <hi>Synechals,</hi> and <hi>Continuals,</hi> in ſpecial ſo call'd, or <hi>Synechals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It matters little that <hi>Synochos</hi> is an unknown word to the Antient Greeks and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Continual</hi> and <hi>Containing</hi> is among the Latins us'd for the ſame; becauſe, where divers Things occur, or are feign'd, which are deſtitute of diſtinct names, we may, yea it becoms us moreover to diſtinguiſh from one another the terms of their Origination and Signification, for a more diſtinct Doctrin's ſake, and uſe every one enough explaind before in a diverſe Senſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therfore they call thoſe Synoch<g ref="char:ougr">ȣ</g>̂s, or <hi>Contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fevers,</hi> which continue <hi>without any Fit</hi> to their laſt and compleat ceaſing; but Synechὲιs, or <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuals,</hi> have the general name of <hi>Fevers;</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they always perſiſt to the end, yet do they daily, or every third or fourth day undergoe ſome Fit: I will examine them in this, theſe in <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. as Intermitting Fevers in the next following.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſaid the <hi>Cauſe of Containing Fevers</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. <hi>Sect.</hi> 24. was in my judgment ſomtimes <hi>Choler,</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:93060:133"/>ſomtimes <hi>Lympha,</hi> and they that flow together with Lympha, ſomtimes <hi>both together</hi> ill affected, raiſing ſuch an Efferveſcency in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, whence <hi>continually the Pulſe is bred more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent againſt Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Who therefore could not unfitly diſtinguiſh theſe <hi>Containing</hi> or <hi>Synochal Fevers,</hi> upon the account of their <hi>diverſe Cauſe,</hi> into <hi>Choleric</hi> and <hi>Lymphatic</hi> Fevers.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And becauſe under the general name <hi>of Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> we do not only comprehend that <hi>Lympha,</hi> which goes from the <hi>Conglobated Glandules,</hi> and <hi>alſo from other Parts</hi> to the Heart; but moreover <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Spittle</hi> it ſelf, proceding from the <hi>Conglomerated Glandules, and ſo the Liquor</hi> that is to ariſe <hi>from the Three-fold Sway of the Guts,</hi> all mixt together with Lympha with the Deſcending Blood; <hi>Lymphatic Fevers</hi> may be ſubdivided into <hi>Glandular, Pancreatic,</hi> and <hi>Salivary Lymphatic Fevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. All theſe Fevers may differ ſomthing according to the divers Conſtitution of other Humors together being in the Body.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I judg that <hi>Burning Fevers</hi> are chiefly produc'd <hi>by Choler;</hi> and <hi>Fevers</hi> coupled with <hi>acute Pains, and Prickings of the Head and Lims</hi> from <hi>the Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Lympha;</hi> as from <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas</hi> any joind with <hi>gripes</hi> and <hi>prickings of the Belly;</hi> laſtly, from the <hi>Spittle,</hi> thoſe which are obſervd troubleſom with <hi>anxieties</hi> and <hi>diſtenſions of the Stomach,</hi> and <hi>the parts near it.</hi> But as oft as ſeveral Humors of thoſe mentiond are together vitiated, ſo oft the Symptoms of more are wont to concur together, as moreover the ſame occur more glentle then is wont, by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual tempering of the Humors peccant.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Choler</hi> at that time is wont to be peccant, either
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93060:133"/>
                  <hi>with a Lixivial Salt Acrimony only,</hi> or <hi>moreover with an Oily Infameableneſs.</hi> Whence there indeed the encreaſd <hi>Heat</hi> is obſervd <hi>ſharper,</hi> here together <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi> The <hi>Pulſe</hi> there other things conſiderd is <hi>more frequent,</hi> here together <hi>greater.</hi> The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin</hi> there <hi>thicker,</hi> here beſide <hi>more colourd. Thirſt</hi> is there very <hi>troubleſom,</hi> here <hi>inſatiable.</hi> The <hi>Tongue</hi> is there <hi>dry,</hi> here together <hi>cloven or black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The Lympha of all, or at leaſt the moſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated Glandul's</hi> being <hi>more ſharp and ſowr,</hi> and raiſing a Feveriſh Efferveſcency in the Right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart, breeds an <hi>Heat</hi> more <hi>corroding</hi> then great, and every where troubleſom <hi>with Gripings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The ſame <hi>Lympha</hi> becoming <hi>more ſharp,</hi> and <hi>ſalt Brine,</hi> or <hi>together Acid, in the Glandul's of the Head eſpecially,</hi> beſide <hi>a ſtoppage,</hi> or burthenſom pain <hi>of the Head,</hi> and hence the <hi>Coryza,</hi> or <hi>Hoarſneſs,</hi> or <hi>a Cough</hi> afterward following, is wont to produce the <hi>Catarrhal Fever</hi> ſo call'd, acompani'd <hi>with Heat,</hi> not ſo vehement and intenſe as <hi>gnawing and ſharp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. In every <hi>Lymphatic Fever,</hi> a light <hi>ſhivering</hi> oft troubleſom is preſent and urgeth. The <hi>Pulſe is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> more then <hi>great.</hi> The <hi>

               <p n="13">13. <hi>The Juice of the Pancreas</hi> being all of it diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly vitiated and made <hi>over-ſharp,</hi> and breeding a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Fever, manifeſts it ſelf both <hi>with Anxieties about the Midrif,</hi> and <hi>Gripes of the Belly,</hi> and <hi>Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> or <hi>bloody Purgings,</hi> or ſharp <hi>Pain</hi> coupled, as alſo <hi>by the Pulſe frequent</hi> chiefly, and inclining to <hi>littleneſs</hi> and <hi>weakneſs;</hi> and afterward <hi>unequal,</hi> with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93060:134"/>the <hi>Appetite</hi> ſomtimes <hi>dejected,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>encreas'd;</hi> with <hi>Thirſt</hi> more rarely urging; with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>crude</hi> and <hi>watry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>The Spittle</hi> breeding <hi>a Containing Fever,</hi> is wont to be peccant with <hi>encreaſd Viſcouſneſs;</hi> whence it is perceivd <hi>more mild</hi> and <hi>ſoft,</hi> the <hi>Appetite</hi> being commonly dejected, and <hi>a burthenſom Pain</hi> following the taking in of Food, ſomtimes <hi>a Diſtenſion</hi> and <hi>puffing up of the Stomach</hi> and <hi>Guts</hi> happening; and ſoon after <hi>Wheazing,</hi> or <hi>Difficult Reſpiration,</hi> and <hi>ſleepineſs;</hi> together with the <hi>frequencie of the Pulſe encreaſd,</hi> one or two hours after Food taken in, again by degrees remitting; and therefore this <hi>Salivary Fever</hi> hath great affinity with that call'd <hi>Hectic,</hi> if it be not a lighter Kind of it, or at leaſt always coupled with the Hectic.</p>
               <p n="15">15. They will leſs wonder or contemn theſe new Diſtinctions and Names of Containing Fevers, who being free from all prejudice, accuratly attend to all the obſervable Symptoms and Depravations of the Humors peccant in ſeveral Feveriſh People, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not the new Anatomical Inventions of this Age; as when compar'd with Chymical Changes, afford a wonderful Light to the intricate Doctrine of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to be extricated eaſier and more happily.</p>
               <p n="16">16. We have taught you before <hi>from what kind of Non-natural Things</hi> the aforeſaid <hi>depravations of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Lympha, the Juice of the Pancreas</hi> and <hi>Spittle</hi> do ariſe, ſo that it ſeems needleſs to ſtay longer here about them, ſeeing they may and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd thence.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But any Studious of Truth may ask, <hi>How Heat troubleſom, though diverſe in theſe Synochal Fevers, is bred from ſo diverſe Cauſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. That to my ability I may endeavour to ſatisfie
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93060:134"/>this juſt Queſtion, I judg, I.

               </p>
               <p n="19">19. II. <hi>I judg that feveriſh Heat is accidentally</hi> bred by the <hi>over-ſowr Lympha of the Conglobated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dul's,</hi> in as much as it <hi>raiſing an Efferveſcency</hi> in <hi>the Right Ventricle of the Heart, with Choler</hi> mixt with <hi>the Blood Aſcending,</hi> aſſaults it ſharper then uſual, and ſo changes or corrupts it, that is, frees or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives it of its viſcouſneſs, that the fiery Particles break forth then more plenteouſly, from which <hi>a ſharper and more fretting Heat</hi> is raiſd by its mixing with a ſowr Liquor, and it not a little varying in certain Circumſtances, according to the diverſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the other parts of the Blood with <hi>a Pulſe more frequent</hi> indeed, but ſeldom together <hi>greater,</hi> but <hi>oft</hi> rather <hi>Leſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. III. I likewiſe think <hi>that Feveriſh Heat is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally bred by the Juice of the Pancreas wholly over-ſowr,</hi> in as much as <hi>Choler</hi> is not only too much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd and broken by it in the <hi>ſmall Gut,</hi> but the <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ariſing from the confuſion of Both, and of the Salivary Phlegm being more ſowr then is wont, when it com's with Lympha <hi>to the Right Ventricle of the Heart,</hi> riſes anon more potently againſt the reſt <hi>of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93060:135"/>Choler</hi> aſcending together with the Blood, and after its natural Viſcouſneſs is diminiſht, ſtirs up a ſharp Efferveſcency with it hurtful to the Body, whence likewiſe <hi>not ſo great, as ſharp Heat</hi> breaks forth, and that according to the diverſe difference of the whole Maſs of Blood in ſome, the preſent <hi>Pulſe</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>over-frequent,</hi> and as to greatneſs <hi>Little or Mean,</hi> ſeldom <hi>great,</hi> unleſs Choler together be very Sharp.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For, IV. as oft as <hi>Choler</hi> is found <hi>ſharp and oily enough</hi> in the Body, either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Non-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> (that is, by reaſon of the uſe of a Non-natural Thing, as Summer Air, or Strong Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd a while) and yet not depraving any Function, and <hi>the Acidity of Lympha,</hi> or <hi>of the Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> or <hi>of Both both be ſuddenly and ſo far</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſd by a Non-natural Thing, as the over-cold Air, or ſowr Drink, to wit, Rheniſh-Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that thereby <hi>a Synochal Fever</hi> be bred, no wonder if <hi>Heat,</hi> not only <hi>ſharper,</hi> but together <hi>greater,</hi> be then ſtird up by over-ſharp, and together over-fat Choler concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and <hi>a moſt frequent Pulſe</hi> be joind with one <hi>greater,</hi> but not the greateſt.</p>
               <p n="22">22. But, V. when <hi>Spittle</hi> is peccant with ſuch <hi>a Viſcouſneſs,</hi> whence not only <hi>the Fermentation of Food is leſs commodious,</hi> but moreover <hi>uſually two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are taken in, the Pulſe</hi> being now frequent, becoms <hi>ſtill for ſome ſpace more frequent,</hi> with <hi>Heat,</hi> ſeldom indeed manifeſt or troubleſom to the Sick, yet ſomtimes notable to By-ſtanders and Phyſicians, beſide the encreaſd redneſs of the Cheeks; I judg that that Change haps, both as to the Pulſe over-frequent, both continually, and yet more after Food taken in, and as to any kind of Heat then together obſervable, in as much as <hi>Spittle</hi> tending to the ſmall Gut, the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93060:135"/>Stomach being empty, doth ſo <hi>vitiate the Efferveſcency of Choler, and the Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> that <hi>a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi> proceding from theſe three, <hi>is</hi> not only <hi>dull'd,</hi> but moreover <hi>Vapors ſomwhat flatulent ariſe</hi> from <hi>it,</hi> and indeed <hi>more plenteous</hi> and <hi>more volatil,</hi> when the moſt fluid Part of Food ſlides down to the Guts, uſually two hours after it is taken in. Which <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors</hi> being carri'd to the <hi>Heart,</hi> both <hi>provoke it to a more frequent Contraction of it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>being carri'd every way</hi> together with the Blood, breed <hi>an Heat not ſo great</hi> indeed, or <hi>very ſharp,</hi> or grievous and troubleſom to the Sick, yet coupled <hi>with drineſs of the Skin</hi> enough manifeſt, had for a ſign of Heat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſd; and <hi>with redneſs of the Cheeks,</hi> according to their notable oft encreaſd plenty and volatility; whilſt in the mean time <hi>a more frequent Pulſe</hi> indeed, and <hi>little and weak enough</hi> is obſervd; <hi>the Leanneſs of the whole Body</hi> concurring and daily encreaſd, by reaſon of the Blood made daily over-viſcous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to nouriſh the Body.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And now we have reduc'd <hi>all Synochal Fevers upon the account of their Cauſes,</hi> that are wont to be notably peccant in Mans Body to the <hi>four primary Differences,</hi> we think fit to conſider, and here weigh in a few words alſo ſome <hi>of their Differences</hi> taken <hi>from the more grievous Symptoms eft accompanying them,</hi> after the Example of <hi>Famous Practitioners,</hi> and chiefly Great <hi>Platerus:</hi> not mentioning farther <hi>a Catarrhal Fever,</hi> of which we ſpake in <hi>Sect.</hi> 11.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Of Intermitting Fevers.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>INtermitting Fevers</hi> are ſuch as moleſt the Sick with divers Fits, which of their own accord do wholly depart, and then come again anew.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For as oft as the Sick are troubled <hi>with a Fever, returning either in certain or uncertain Intervals,</hi> no Error being committed in the Non-natural Things, by <hi>Internal Cauſes;</hi> ſo oft it's ſaid to <hi>Intermit,</hi> that is, not continually afflict, but return by Fits, and again wholly ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As oft on the contrary as a <hi>Fever</hi> is ſtird up, not by <hi>Internal,</hi> but <hi>External Cauſes,</hi> and chiefly by one or more Errors committed in the Non-natural Things, ſo oft it is call'd <hi>only a Fever;</hi> till it may probably be thought to prove either Continual, and that <hi>of One day,</hi> with or without Fits, <hi>by Symptoms accompanying it;</hi> or elſe after ſome certain days its kind may certainly be determind.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For they aſcribe too much to themſelvs, that do vainly boaſt to obtain a fame of quick Judgment amongſt ignorant People, (though oft taken in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes) that they can certainly, determin even in the very firſt Invaſion, and at the beginning of the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any Fever, whether it will be but of One day, or with or without Fits; and indeed whether it will be a <hi>Quotidian, Tertian,</hi> or <hi>Quartan-Fever.</hi> Which Thraſonic boaſts we willingly yield to them, who feed themſelvs and others with ſinoak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Wind.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:93060:144"/>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>different Kinds</hi> of Intermitting Fevers, are taken; 1. From the divers <hi>Interval,</hi> ſomtimes ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſomtimes longer, which happens between the Fits. 2. From the <hi>grievous differing Symptoms</hi> which uſe to accompany them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I. By reaſon of the divers <hi>Intervals, Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fevers</hi> are divided into <hi>Quotidians, Tertians, Quartans, Quintans,</hi> &amp;c. in ſo much as they return either every day, or in the Third, Fourth, or Fifth Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we have oft told you we obſerv'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13, &amp;c. to be ſomtimes Single, other-times <hi>Manifold, Double, Three-fold,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Divers,</hi> adding the Signs that diſtinguiſh them from one another.</p>

By reaſon of the <hi>grievous Symptoms,</hi> as we have already ſaid in <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. <hi>Sect.</hi> 23, &amp;c. of Synochals, Intermitting Fevers get divers Names. For, I. they are ſomtimes obſerv'd <hi>Chill,</hi> not only with Cold chiefly, but with Cold only, troubleſom; ſo that ſomtimes, and moſt frequently a gentle Heat, ſomtimes and more ſeldom none at all doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Such Fevers, even always Cold, we have had in our Academic Hoſpital, ſo manifeſt, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the beginning, and augmentation, but even in the vigor and declination, yea, at the end of the Fit, that is, always both to their Own, and the By-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and alſo the Phyſicians perceivance, the Sick were troubleſomly all-over cold, never warm, much leſs hot in any part. And theſe grievous Chill Fevers are perhaps always <hi>Quotidians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. But the more troubleſom Intermitting Fevers do ſo oft come with <hi>Gold</hi> preceding, as with <hi>Heat</hi> following, that they have taken their Name from it; not only in the moſt of the Regions of <hi>Germany,</hi> and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93060:145"/>others of the North, but moſt of the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think they have the Fever only ſo long as they endure ſharp Cold, judging themſelvs freed from the Fever ſo ſoon as Heat often not at all, or but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubleſom or grievous begins. And then ſuch moſt commonly are Quartans, ſomtimes Tertians.</p>
               <p n="10">10. II. Oft Intermitting Fevers are <hi>Burning,</hi> and chiefly <hi>Tertians,</hi> in which a ſhort and light only, or almoſt no Cold is noted, or a gentle Shivering Fit to precede Heat, and extreme Burning, and that oft remains long, and is always troubleſom after the Fit is ended: So that ſomtimes a new Fit returns before, that the great Heat of the former doth wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But it is not neceſſary, that therfore the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould be thought to have remain'd together with the Heat remaining, becauſe the Pulſe remits of its former ſwiftneſs; but the encreaſd Heat of the Body does not return to its former temper: Whence ſomtimes alſo a Continual Fever by degrees follows ſuch an Intermitting Fever, and becoms a Continual Tertian.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But although ſomtimes Intermitting Fevers trouble the Sick with Cold only, or Heat, yet, <hi>for the moſt part,</hi> they are moleſted with both, and <hi>Heat uſes to ſuccede Cold;</hi> and then <hi>ſomtimes Cold, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Heat does moſt oppreſs them, or continue longer, rarely afflicting them equally.</hi> For they are utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, who by their falſe Prejudices, and againſt daily Experience, do falſly teach their Pupils, that the preceding Cold is overcomd by two-fold, three-fold, or four-fold Heat ſucceding, either upon the account of its <hi>Continuance</hi> or <hi>Vehemence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. For, briefly to deſcribe the Hiſtory and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Invaſion</hi> and <hi>Change</hi> of the moſt of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93060:145"/>Fevers, according to their two-fold newly mentiond Symptoms moſt frequent above others, and moſt noted, but withal not neglecting the reſt, there is wont to precede as a Fore-runner, a <hi>Yauning</hi> and <hi>Gaping,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Wearineſs of the Lims,</hi> or <hi>Unquietneſs,</hi> rarely <hi>Sleepineſs,</hi> and more or leſs to continue and moleſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14. To one or more of theſe troubles there ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for the moſt part (at leaſt as far as I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv in my Patients) <hi>Coldneſs in the Region of the Loins,</hi> and truly ſomtimes more grievous, other-times more light; which a little after goes in the Paſſage of the Back-bone, as well upward as downward, to <hi>all the Remote Parts of the Body,</hi> and which not only manifeſts it ſelf in the <hi>Fingers</hi> and <hi>Toes,</hi> but in the <hi>Noſe, Ears, Chin, Tongue,</hi> yea and moreover in the Whole Skin, afflicting and moleſting the inward as well as the outward parts.</p>

               <p n="19">19. Upon the beginning of Cold, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv, that as the <hi>Pulſe</hi> grows <hi>more frequent,</hi> it is both
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93060:146"/>
                  <hi>Leſs</hi> and <hi>Weaker,</hi> and while it ſtill troubles, it's <hi>ſo Little,</hi> that often it can no longer be Felt.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Where the Cold begins to remit, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Anxieties about the Midrif,</hi> are wont to be the beginnings of <hi>Heat</hi> even juſt following.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Yea even with <hi>Heat, Thirſt</hi> by degrees is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and encreaſd; for ſeldom during Cold does it trouble; but ſomtimes notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Farther, with Heat the <hi>Pulſe, continually more frequent,</hi> is by degrees made <hi>Greater,</hi> and for the moſt part alſo <hi>Stronger.</hi> For if it be then <hi>Little</hi> or <hi>Weak,</hi> the Fever is judg'd <hi>Malign,</hi> or a <hi>great want of Strength,</hi> and ſo the danger is encreaſd.</p>
               <p n="23">23. When the <hi>Heat is augmented,</hi> commonly there attends <hi>Drowth of the Tongue, more vehement,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>Difficult; Heat of the Head, and Pain, Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Temples, Watchings,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. Laſt of all by degrees while the Heat remits, <hi>Sweat</hi> is uſually wont to ſpring out <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs,</hi> or at leaſt a <hi>ſufficient voiding of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin.</hi> And then the Sick is free again for a time from all, or at leaſt the moſt Symptoms by a <hi>various</hi> Sleep, one while more quiet, other whiles very unquiet and grievous, with Dreams or Wakings uſually concurring; till a new Feveriſh Fit coming on, either the ſame, or fewer, or more do afflict him more or leſs; which at length, either of their own accord, or by Art, are wholly or at leaſt in part taken away, or take him away.</p>
               <p n="25">25. And ſo are many tormented with Intermitting Fevers, whilſt Cold precedes, and Heat ſuccedes: although ſomtimes, (that we may go forward unto the reſt of their Accompanying Symptoms). III. They are obſervd <hi>Epialae</hi> ſo call'd, <hi>mixt Fevers,</hi> in which every where <hi>Cold and Heat</hi> together vehemently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:93060:146"/>
               <p n="26">26. IV. They are call'd <hi>Thirſty Fevers</hi> from Thirſt importunate and paſt quenching; which are not only obſerv'd uſually in burning Heat, but even whilſt Cold troubles; ſo that though the Sick do drink continually, yet nevertheleſs they do thirſt. Nor have the Sick only this great trouble, although they much indulge themſelves to too much Drink, but even Phyſicians alſo in curing this froward Thirſt.</p>
               <p n="27">27. V. Let us call them Hungry Fevers, to which ravenous and unſatiable Hunger is joind; ſo that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Meat be given, even whileſt the Fit continues, the Sick takes Faintings, and other troubleſom Symptoms. For although the Appetite of moſt is Leſſend or Aboliſht ſomtimes wholly; nevertheleſs others have, not only a moderat but greedy Hunger together with the Fit.</p>
               <p n="28">28. VI. <hi>Heart-aking Intermitting Fevers</hi> do mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, often with an unſpeakable and intolerable Pain accompanying, about the upper Orifice of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and with this Symptom chiefly are they grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and ſomtimes Peſtilential, whether attended with Vomiting or no.</p>
               <p n="29">29. VII. Moreover Fevers ſeem to be nam'd <hi>Griping or Colical,</hi> from the painful Gripes of the Belly, or which are wonderfully troubleſom with Diſtenſions, coming or departing as the Intermitting Fever comes or goes.</p>
               <p n="30">30. VIII. <hi>Swouning Fevers</hi> get their name from Swouning Fits invading the Sick, together with the Fever, very grievous and dangerous, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in no wiſe to be paſſd over with ſilence.</p>
               <p n="31">31. IX. Intermitting Fevers are obſervd from their accompanying Hypochondiacal Suffocation, commonly call'd Hyſterical, with a Feveriſh Fit grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93060:147"/>afflicting, (chiefly Women) are to be nam'd <hi>Strangling Fevers,</hi> ſeeing indeed ſomtimes they choak and kill the Sick, although they be not alſo very grievous, as to other Symptoms.</p>
               <p n="32">32. X. Let us now join <hi>Difficultly breathing Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> to the aboveſaid, ſo namd from the difficulty and wheaſing of breath, which wonderfully and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably vex the Sick, with or without <hi>Palpitation of the Heart.</hi> Theſe I have oft obſerv'd to begin with <hi>diſtention of the Abdomen,</hi> and <hi>Anxiety of the Midrif,</hi> the <hi>Pulſe</hi> being <hi>Little, Weak,</hi> and <hi>Swift, Cold</hi> and <hi>Pain</hi> alſo troubling the <hi>Region</hi> of the <hi>Loins.</hi> Which if <hi>Wind</hi> break out either upward or downward then the Fit was <hi>lighter,</hi> if not, more tedious: For after the Diſtenſion and Anxiety had laſted an hour or more, both decreaſed gradually, and alſo a <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Breathing</hi> and <hi>great Wheaſing</hi> was ſtird up, and indeed ſo great, that the Body could not endure even the leaſt ſtirring or motion of it ſelf, the <hi>Pulſe</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually growing <hi>Greater</hi> rather then <hi>Stronger,</hi> and continually <hi>Swifter,</hi> together with the <hi>Veins all over ſore ſweld,</hi> which were ſo ſmall, that they could ſcarce be ſeen when the Fit was not. This <hi>Difficult Breathing</hi> ſomtimes moleſts more grievouſly, other times more lightly, again a longer or ſhorter ſpace; whence ſomtimes fit Medicins for the Hypochondriac Strangulation have been us'd with ſucceſs. And at length the <hi>Fit ended more with a Moiſtneſs then with a Sweat,</hi> till a new one came on, <hi>ſeldom a Quotidian, oft a Tertian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="33">33. XI. <hi>Aſthmatic Fevers,</hi> ſo call'd, from ſhort-windedneſs accompanying, ſomtimes grievous, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not are uſual. In which likewiſe the Diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Anxiety of the Abdomen uſually precedes; and when they remit, then follows Difficulty of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93060:147"/>Breath, truly Aſthmatic, which together with the Fit continuing long enough, and ſomtimes for one, or two days, decreaſes, and at length ceaſes; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it continues after the Fit is gone. I have ſeen an Aſthmatical Fever of this ſort <hi>returning for a time in the fourteenth day,</hi> and afflicting the Sick ſore enough for more days every time, unleſs it were leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened both as to its pain and continuance, with fit Medicius.</p>
               <p n="34">34. XII. A Cough is not only wont to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theſe above deſcrib'd Aſthmatical Fevers, but at other times when there is no Aſthma at all, from which Cough then ſorely troubling the Sick, above other Symptoms, I thought they might very fitly be nam'd <hi>Coughing</hi> or <hi>Bechical Fevers.</hi> For ſo ſoon as the Fit increaſes, a <hi>Cough</hi> begins to moleſt, for the moſt part <hi>Dry,</hi> ſeldom and that by chance is it <hi>Moiſt;</hi> to wit, as oft as a various Humor mov'd, either of its own accord, or by a Fever, or by a dry Cough ſlides down to the Lungs.</p>
               <p n="35">35. XIII. Amongſt Intermitting Fevers alſo are obſervd <hi>Catarrhal Fevers,</hi> from a Catarrh deſcending not only upon the Lungs, but even alſo to other Parts, moving and ceaſing with the Feveriſh Fit. For a new Humor does not diſperſe it ſelf after the Feveriſh Fit, but that which has already diſperſt it ſelf, does not return or forſake the part grieved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Feveriſh Fit ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="36">36. XIV. Somtimes Practitioners reduce <hi>Gouty Fevers</hi> to the Catarrhal, becauſe they think the Gouty Fevers ariſe from the other. And becauſe I judg that a different Humor which breeds the Gout is carri'd to the Jaws through the Arteries together with the Blood, I altogether think the Arthritics are to be diſtinguiſht from the Catarrhals: As often
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93060:148"/>as I had opportunity to obſerv very exactly the Riſe and Progreſs of the Gout by my Patients faithful narration, even ſo oft I have minded that it has ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen together with a Continual or Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Whence the Gout was not a little augmented by the return of the new Fits of the Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, till it was either chang'd into a Continual Fever, or ceaſed of its own accord, or was Cur'd by Art, the Pains of the Joints perſevering nevertheleſs.</p>
               <p n="37">37. XV. As Continual, ſo Intermitting Fevers are oft attended with <hi>Mad</hi> and <hi>Raving Fevers,</hi> call'd by the Dutch <hi>Raſende Koortſen,</hi> from their <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> ſeldom indeed during <hi>Cold,</hi> but oft when <hi>Heat</hi> does follow the <hi>Head-ach,</hi> and <hi>Pulſing of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and then ceaſing by degrees with the Fit again, and that after Sleep, either pleaſant or troubleſom with wakings.</p>
               <p n="38">38. XVI. The <hi>Emetic,</hi> or <hi>Vomiting</hi> Intermitting Fevers are ſo call'd from the Vomiting that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continually, other-times by intervals are very troubleſom, either when the Cold begins, or in its continuance, or in the appearance or encreaſe of Heat: ſo much the more grievous, that the Sick are not thereby eaſed, but more griev'd. Whence that Vomiting is deſervedly judg'd Symptomatical, and not Critical.</p>
               <p n="39">39. XVII. So Intermitting Fevers alſo are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d from a great and frequent Purging, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo with Gripes much troubling and weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sick at divers times of their Continuance, therefore to be call'd <hi>Emptying</hi> or <hi>Cleanſing Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="40">40. XVIII. The Fits of moſt Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers uſe not only to end with a Sweat good for the Sick, and therfore then to be eſteem'd Critical; but
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93060:148"/>oft for the moſt part of the Fit a great Sweat, hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Sick, and therefore Symptomatical, moſt commonly hot, ſeldom cold Breaths out of the whole Body, or a particular part, as the Head, Breaſt, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, or Lims, which makes the <hi>Sweating Fevers:</hi> Such alſo are Continual Fevers obſervd to be, that are known by the Name of <hi>The Engliſh Sweat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="41">41. XIX. But Intermitting Fevers are alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd with almoſt a continual Urining, and that Symptomatical, weakening the Sick, not Critical and eaſing them; which therfore may fitly be call'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Fevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="42">42. XX. Laſtly that I may put an end to theſe partly new names, Intermitting Fevers are obſervd to be accompanied with a grievous and troubleſom Spitting, and therfore to be nam'd <hi>Spitting Fevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="43">43. Without doubt there are yet many more Kinds and Differences of Intermitting Fevers to be nam'd from their grievous and moleſting Symptoms; but let it ſuffice to have mentiond the moſt notable ones, which I being much hurried could call to Mind.</p>
               <p n="44">44. If any ask me the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers differing ſo many ways among themſelvs; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That one cauſe makes an Intermitting Fever, as Intermitting, and another makes it of this or that Kind, in as much as it returns in this or that day, or is accompanied with theſe or other grievous Symptoms.</p>
               <p n="45">45. If any where, certainly in aſſigning the true Cauſe of all and every <hi>Intermitting Fever,</hi> the great difference of Doctors of Phyſic is obſervd, laſtly mine alſo perhaps varies not a little from the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the reſt; I now intend more deeply to enquire, more accuratly to examin, and explain more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitly then ever I did before, all this hard and intricat buſineſs chiefly upon their account who never heard
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93060:149"/>or are like to hear me publicly, or ever have hall or may have conference with me about this Matter: Which I will do as much as I may for my Concerns, and Diſtractions daily encreaſing, rather then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, and therfore perpetually withdrawing my Mind from an attentive Meditation, wholly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite here, my privat Auditory tarrying for the ſame, and the Printer daily urging.</p>
               <p n="46">46. There is therfore <hi>requir'd to produce an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fever;</hi> that is, which returning ſomtimes in certain, other-times uncertain, now in ſhorter, othertimes in longer Intervals, and indeed after a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Ceſſation, and that alſo ſomtimes longer, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhorter by new Fits longer and ſhorter like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe both on the account of Cold and Heat, which ſeeing it is not in the Blood, otherwiſe it would be a Continual Fever, is mixt with it and carri'd to the Right Ventricle of the Heart; and truly 1.

               <p n="52">52. If the <hi>Blood ſtand ſtill any where,</hi> preſently there ariſes an <hi>Inflammation:</hi> which if communicated to the reſt of the Blood, in like manner produces not an Intermitting, but Continual Fever.

               <p n="53">53. The Blood therfore herein being laid aſide, I. <hi>None will judg that Intermitting Fevers, as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, can be deduc'd from Choler,</hi> who hath dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſiderd, that it cannot be ſo infected and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in its Paſſages ſuddenly by any External Cauſe, ſo as to be ſtopt either wholly or in part in its motion for a time, and again either of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or for any other demonſtrable Internal Cauſe ſhould find a way, by which it may produce the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93060:150"/>Symptoms above noted, by what way ſoever it's brought to the Heart, and that either alone, or joind with others.</p>
               <p n="54">54. I do not deny that <hi>Choler</hi> is <hi>turnd</hi> into <hi>ſmaller</hi> or <hi>bigger Stones,</hi> and alſo into a <hi>Stony Cruſt</hi> in its Paſſages through the Liver: But as neither coms ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, ſo neither is it obſervd that either of them were diſſolv'd by any Internal, but only External Cauſe, nor yet ſo, that any thing like to Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fevers can thence be deduc'd.</p>
               <p n="55">55. In like manner ſomtimes Choler is judgd <hi>not to be carri'd down to the Small Gut</hi> from what cauſe ſoever, when the Excrements are obſcurly white and thicker then uſual. But an <hi>Intermitting Fever</hi> is not always obſervd to accompany the Jaundies, although often it doth; which therfore cannot be taken thence for an impediment of Choler.</p>
               <p n="56">56. II. <hi>Neither from the Lympha can Intermitting Fevers, as Intermitting, be deriv'd.</hi> For, beſides that the moſt Symptoms accompanying them for the moſt part, and obſervable chiefly in the Abdomen, cannot be expected even in a Dream, from the Lympha; beſides, if <hi>Intermitting Fevers</hi> did depend of, and were produc'd by the Lympha, then either all, or but part of the Lympha were faulty, as though it were hindred and farthered again reciprocally in its Motion to the Heart. If all? where and what kind of Impediment could that be? whether or no in all the Conglobated Glandula's, Muſcles and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els? or in all the Lymphatic Veſſels, or their Trunk about their inſertion into the Jugular or Axillar left Vein? But if only a part thereof, then which and where? Whether that which goes only to the Heart from all or ſome only of the Conglobated Glandules? Or whether it be hindred in all the Glandules? But
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93060:151"/>theſe Glandules are rarely found to ſwell or be hard, and that only when the Head is ſtuft, or in Catarrhal Fevers (of which we ſpake in the former Chapter) ſcarce ever, though the Intermitting Fever be very troubleſom, the Cauſes whereof we ſearch: ſo that, by how much the more diligently any ſearches the Riſe and Motion of the <hi>Lympha,</hi> as alſo its Supply and Veſſels, ſo much the leſs will he encline to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Cauſe of <hi>Intermitting Fevers</hi> as ſuch to the Lympha.</p>
               <p n="57">57. III. <hi>Intermitting Fevers, as Intermitting, in no wiſe ſeem to be deduc'd from Spittle.</hi> For (that we transfer not hither more Arguments from what is now ſaid of Lympha) although ſomtimes, for that is not perpetual, a little before the Feveriſh Fit, or together with its Beginning, the Spittle is obſervd to flow more plentifully or ſlowly unto the Mouth, notwithſtanding the ſame Spittle is not noted to be ſuch, that the moleſting Symptoms of every <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fever,</hi> I ſay not all, but even the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, may folidly be aſcribed to it. The Spittle is not always, I ſay, carri'd, which if ſo, ſhould whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be carri'd in the time of Intermiſſion, more ſlowly to the Mouth, and more plenteouſly while the Fit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins or moleſts; and ſomtimes the contrary, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neither happens. But the Vitiations which are found in the Spittle, do nothing leſs then teſtifie the primary, but rather the ſecondary Vitiation of Spittle, as it will more evidently appear from what is to be ſaid hereafter.</p>
               <p n="58">58. IV. <hi>Any Man may eaſily think that Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fevers, as Intermitting, are to be deduc'd from the Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> who ſhall obſerve with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Mind, all and every of the <hi>Requiſites,</hi> noted in <hi>Sect.</hi> 46, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to produce them, to concur here and only here.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:93060:151"/>
               <p n="59">59. For 1. This <hi>Juice is carri'd</hi> from the very <hi>Pancreas, in ſuch a Part, which by its Veſſels</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Paſſages (as it is ſaid in <hi>Sect.</hi> 50.) mediatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates with the Right Ventricle of the Heart.</p>
               <p n="60">60. 2. The ſame Juice is carri'd <hi>by ſuch Veſſels,</hi> to wit, the Lateral or Side Paſſages, <hi>in one or more wherof, it may be ſo infected and afflicted by an Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe, that it may ſuddenly be ſtopt in ſome part, in its motion, and hindred for a certain time, leaſt it ſhould continually go to the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="61">61. And that falls out, as oft as <hi>Phlegm,</hi> which uſes to be much gatherd and accumulated in the Small Gut, is <hi>diſſolvd</hi> either by Heat of Air, or a vehement Motion of Body, or Watchings prolongd, or Care of Mind, or Anger continu'd, or Meats, Sauces, or ſharp Medicins, or elſe by any other Cauſe; and then being <hi>mixt with the Blood,</hi> is carri'd together with it all over <hi>to all parts of the Body,</hi> and being joind more or leſs every where <hi>with all the Humors,</hi> is carri'd <hi>with the ſame in their Veſſels;</hi> Whence as in other places, ſo in the <hi>Lateral Paſſages of the Pancreas,</hi> I mean the ſtrait ones, <hi>the ſame Phlegm thickens, ſtops the ſame Paſſages, and hinders that the Juice</hi> ſtanding ſtill there, <hi>cannot go into the Middle and Greater Paſſage and ſo forward,</hi> for ſome ſudden External Cauſe, which is apt to Coagulate Phlegm, (as Air frozen or blown with chill Winds, or with any Blaſt cauſing cold, Rain or any Water touching the Body, and afflicting it with its coldneſs, Drink of any cold Liquor, eſpecially when taken in a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; A ſudden and eſpecially unexpected Terror, and great Grief of Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="62">62. And perhaps this happens eaſier, and ofter in the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> then in all the Parts of the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Phlegm is eaſier and more plentifully joind
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93060:152"/>and tranſported to the Acid Matter of the Juice of the Pancreas, exceding all the other Humors in Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; and again it ſeparates eaſily, when Coagulated by any Cauſe; wherby the Separation between that Acid, though not very ſharp, Juice, and Phlegm, though Clammy, being only confus'd, in no wiſe wholly mixt, is promoted.</p>
               <p n="63">63" Nor have we only <hi>Concluded that the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Pancreas in the Lateral Paſſages, may be in probability</hi> by the now mentiond Cauſes in part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, and mutually receiving one another, but <hi>we have evidently cleard,</hi> by ocular inſpection more then once, that it is <hi>actually done</hi> in our Diſſections of Bodies.</p>
               <p n="64">64. For ſomtimes among our Diſſections, even publicly, ſeveral being then preſent in our Academic Hoſpital of the Sick, beſides other grievous Diſeaſes, we had the Bodies of thoſe that died of <hi>Intermitting Fevers,</hi> and indeed often manifold, and of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; we forc'd in a liquid Volatil Salt coloured blew into the Paſſage of the Pancreas, where it opens into the ſmall Gut, by a Syringe fit for this matter. Which Salt, becauſe it pierced only into ſome, and not into all the Glandules at firſt, (though the next day it opend all) whileſt it entred into both thoſe that were near and remote, and indeed ſome near, as well as remote were not colourd, and dy'd them of its colour, there muſt needs be ſome obſtacle, which hindred the infus'd Liquor, from paſſing through all the Lateral Paſſages of the Pancreas, into the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glandules, which all the Spectators beheld, and without doubt could not but acknowledg the ſame.</p>
               <p n="65">65. And that that hindrance was an <hi>Obſtruction by a thick and viſcous Humor ſtuffing up the Lateral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages;</hi> I therfore affirm, becauſe (beſide which,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93060:152"/>none, not the leaſt ſign of Compreſſion, or of any other kind of Straitneſs, to which this can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd did preſent it ſelf) all the Antecedent Cauſes, as oft as they come to be known, and the Symptoms wonted to accompany <hi>Intermitting Fevers,</hi> and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the moſt rational and certain Manner of curing them, are found to agree, and exactly to ſquare with an Obſtruction.</p>
               <p n="66">66. 3. <hi>Such is the Juice of the Pancreas, as that it may of its own accord get ſuch a vitiation by its delay and ſtanding ſtill alone in its Lateral Paſſages; as that then all the Symptoms of Intermitting Fevers, though never ſo different, may commodiouſly and without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be reduc'd to it, partly alone, and partly joind to others, hereafter to be determind and confirmd by a rational and certain Cure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="67">67.

               <p n="68">68. This <hi>Juice</hi> becauſe it is <hi>ſowriſh,</hi> therefore <hi>is ſuch</hi> alſo, <hi>which by its delay and ſtanding ſtill, is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated of its own accord in any of its Paſſages, and indeed ſo, that firſt of all it becoms more Acid then uſual; and hence diſſolvs the Phlegm obſtructing its Paſſages</hi> either wholly, and then carrying it out, or at leaſt <hi>pieces and paſſes through;</hi> and at length both <hi>Alone,</hi> and <hi>joind with other Humors</hi> afterward to be explaind, is not only like to produce, but indeed <hi>produces ill

               </p>
               <p n="69">69. For daily Experience teſtifies, that any <hi>Acids, become always of their own accord more Acid.</hi> So Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar the older, ſo much the ſowr. The Reaſon wherof I take to be this; to wit, that the <hi>Acrimony of Acids</hi> is then encreaſd, becauſe the Volatil Spirits that temper that Acidity, do at leaſt in part vaniſh away, whence no wonder, if any Acid Liquor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept, grows ſenſibly more Acid. By the ſame means the making of Vinegar may be promoted, though unknown to many, in a common place warmd with Fire, or expos'd to the Sun on an Houſe top; for by theſe means a way is prepar'd for the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ſpeedy efflux of the Volatil Spirits.</p>
               <p n="70">70. And as any Acid Liquors not within our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, do of their own accord and more encreaſe in Acidity; ſo within the ſame, the <hi>Symptoms</hi> both in Melancholic Diſeaſes ſo call'd, and which here is more requiſite, thoſe that are obſervable in the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of <hi>Intermitting Fevers,</hi> and as they oft riſe without the wrong uſe of any Acids, ſo are they to be <hi>referd to an Acid Liquor,</hi> theſe, I ſay, do prove that the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas by being ſtopt</hi> does grow more Acid, which therfore we intend ſtrait way to ſearch more accuratly.</p>
               <p n="71">71. The Jaice of the Pancreas grows Acid with ſtanding ſtill in its Paſſages, becauſe the Volatil Spirit which is naturally conjoind to it, and ſo tempers it, departs then gradually more and more.</p>
               <p n="72">72. This <hi>Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> by ſtanding ſtill as aforeſaid, becoming <hi>more Sharp and Acid,</hi> begins to uſe its force, and to <hi>Cut the Phlegm</hi> that <hi>ſtops</hi> its Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; which if it prevail with ſo much toughneſs and thickneſs, that it cannot be wholly cleanſd, looſed,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93060:153"/>and thence remov'd, it pierces it then, and opens a way for it ſelf by force to paſs through.</p>
               <p n="73">73. We intend to deduce the riſe of all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable Symptoms in Intermitting Fevers, from the too much Acidity of the Juice of the Pancreas, and other Humors joind to it, after we have premis'd in a word the <hi>fourth Requiſite, Sect.</hi> 49. alſo here to concur, <hi>to wit, that the Phlegm</hi> that <hi>obſtructs the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Paſſages of the Pancreas,</hi> which not only compels <hi>the Juice</hi> for a time <hi>to ſtand ſtill there,</hi> but moreover <hi>when it has yielded it an Out-let, cauſd by its Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, does preſently again come together, grow in one, and ſo repairs and renues the Obſtruction that was in part opend, and hence ſtops likewiſe that Juice ſo long in the ſame place, till being let out alſo as the former, in an open way, it produces a new Fit; and that ſo long continu'd, till the Fever and Obſtruction be wholly cur d any way</hi> or the Sick himſelf deſtroy'd.</p>

               <p n="116">116. XX.

               <p n="117">117. From what has been ſaid, I ſuppoſe that the Cauſes of many other Intermitting Fevers with moſt grievous <hi>Pain of the Head, and Teeth,</hi> and other parts, or any other notable Symptom may eaſily be unfolded by thoſe which are Ingenious, wherfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to the Cure of all and every of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers propos'd and explaind, let us mention their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in returning, according to the Intervals of their Fits now ſhorter, other-times longer in Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Tertians, Quartans, Quintans, and others, as alſo the Reaſon and Cauſes of their difference, which I take to be moſt true, and intend to apply them explaind to my Opinion.</p>
               <p n="118">118. And although I do not wholly follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manner of theſe Sorts commonly aſcrib'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, yet do I not think that theſe divers Humors are here to be neglected, ſeeing that, as ſhall appear by what is to be ſaid, if they cauſe not that diverſity immediatly, they much contribute, to do it medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly.</p>
               <p n="119">119. As therfor the new Fit of every Intermitting Fever is ſtird up according as we have taught, ſo oft as the Juice of the Pancreas becoming ſharper by its Obſtruction, bores through the Phlegm that obſtructs its Lateral Paſſages and paſſes to the ſmall Gut, and hence having raiſed an Efferveſcency vitiated howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever with Choler, and other Symptoms in the ſame place, and adjacent parts carri'd through the Lacteal Veins, and Thoracic Paſſage, and the hollow upper Vein into the Right Ventricle of the Heart, and ſo forward: ſo the ſame <hi>new Fit, is raiſd ſooner, or later,</hi> as <hi>Phlegm obſtructing the Lateral Paſſage of the Pancreas is pierc'd, and bored through by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiond Juice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="120">120. And this piercing and <hi>penetrating of Phlegm
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93060:158"/>Obſtructing, is ſooner or later,</hi> both upon the account of the <hi>Phlegm</hi> it ſelf obſtructing the Paſſage, and alſo of the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas piercing through it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="121">121. For by how much the <hi>more viſcous and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Phlegm is,</hi> by ſo much the more difficulty and ſo ſlowly will it be pierced through: and on the contrary, the <hi>leſſer</hi> and <hi>leſs Glutinous it is,</hi> the eaſier and ſo the ſooner will it be pierc'd through.</p>
               <p n="122">122. Again, the more Acid this <hi>Juice of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas is</hi> of it ſelf, the ſooner will it acquire by its obſtruction a greater and ſufficient Acrimony to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the Phlegm obſtructing eaſier and ſooner: and on the contrary, the <hi>more obtuſe or ſowr</hi> and <hi>little</hi> this <hi>Juice</hi> is, ſo much the <hi>ſlowlier</hi> can it acquire a ſufficient Acrimony to cut through the Phlegm.</p>
               <p n="123">123. Therfore by how much the <hi>leſs and leſs glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Phlegm</hi> obſtructing is, and the <hi>Juice</hi> of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> be more <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Plentiful,</hi> ſo much the <hi>ſooner</hi> will a new Fit of an Intermitting Fever ariſe, and ſo a <hi>Quotidian,</hi> that is, one returning in the ſpace of about 24 hours.</p>
               <p n="124">124. Again how much the <hi>more viſcous and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Phlegm obſtructing is, and the Juice of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas more obtuſe or tart and little,</hi> ſo much the <hi>ſlower</hi> will the new Fit of the Intermitting Fever be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo a <hi>Quartan</hi> or <hi>Quintan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="125">125. But as oft as 1. <hi>Phlegm obſtructing, and Juice of the Pancreas</hi> are <hi>in a medium,</hi> or 2. The <hi>Juice of the Pancreas is of it ſelf too acid or plentiful, and Phlegm obſtructing too viſcous or plentiful;</hi> or 3. <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas is leſs and leſs Acid,</hi> and Phlegm <hi>leſſer and leſs Glutinous,</hi> ſo oft new Fits of the Fevers will return almoſt every other day, and then they will be <hi>Tertians,</hi> much differing in their Symptoms

               <p n="126">126. And here you may note, that Intermitting Fevers do but ſeldom return in the exact Interval of natural days of 24 hours; but return quicker or ſlower for the moſt part; wherfore then they are ſaid to <hi>anticipate</hi> the appointed and expected Time for ſome hours, which is diſliked; <hi>or to come later,</hi> which is commended, although it matters not whether the Fits anticipate or come later, if ſo be that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and the grievouſneſs of Symptoms daily accompanying be diminiſhd; to which a Phyſician ſhould chiefly give heed when he prognoſticates by Art, and would foretel a change certainly to come.</p>

From what hath already been ſaid, <hi>the Cauſes</hi> of Intermitting Fevers, both <hi>manifold,</hi> and <hi>compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of divers,</hi> may without much difficulty be found out and aſſignd, to wit, the <hi>Obſtruction both various, and in divers Lateral paſſages of the Pancreas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="128">128. But there ſtill remains a difficulty not to be deſpis'd, which is more requiſit in explaining <hi>the multiplication of any ſimple Intermitting Fevers,</hi> to wit, Quartan or Tertian, that is, its change into a double or triple, which I judg to be ſo oft as <hi>new Phlegm is diſſolvd</hi> in the Body, and eſpecially in the Small Gut, by an <hi>Error committed in Diet, or Medicins, Poiſons</hi> rather not rightly us'd, and hence driven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward together with the Blood every whither, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo to the Pancreas; which being again coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in one, or more of its paſſages formerly not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, by what cauſe ſoever, breed an Obſtruction different from the former, more or leſs, which breeds a Fever more or leſs grievous then the former. And
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93060:159"/>if daily Experience do not evince, certainly it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirms this to be ſo.</p>
               <p n="129">129.

               <p n="130">130.

               <p n="198">198.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The notable and moſt grievous kind of theſe Tertian Fevers is call'd <hi>Cauſos,</hi> or a <hi>Burning Fever,</hi> in which a great <hi>Heat</hi> perſevering to the end vexeth, and moleſts the Sick, though remitting a little by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, and hence again more grievouſly afflicting. And beſide that moſt <hi>troubleſom Heat, Thirſt</hi> is then wont vehemently to moleſt the Sick; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Hunger</hi> is wont to be abated. <hi>Drineſs and Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Tongue</hi> often attends theſe, with <hi>Chops</hi> and a <hi>filthy Exulceration of the Lips, horrible Scabs</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward growing upon them. Neither is the <hi>grievous Head-Ake</hi> unuſual in theſe Fevers, together with a <hi>Raving vehement</hi> enough. In ſome the chief Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is a <hi>difficult Gnawing of the Stomach</hi> very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom to the Sick <hi>with</hi> or <hi>without Vomiting.</hi> The <hi>Hicket</hi> alſo grievous to many moleſts ſeveral.

Yea ſomtimes with a new Fit of the Fever they alſo fall into a <hi>Swouning,</hi> or <hi>Syncope,</hi> whence it is then call'd a <hi>Syncopal Fever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. As therfore as well <hi>Synochal,</hi> as <hi>Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> ſo thoſe <hi>Compounded</hi> of both have receivd a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular denomination from the grievous Symptoms ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying, both among the Common People, and among Phyſicians that practice Phyſic, and in the Cure not without cauſe attentive.</p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:93060:168"/>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Primary Cauſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Synechal Fevers, whereby they moleſt the Sick with a great and continual Heat</hi> is <hi>Choler</hi> peccant by too much Acrimony and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamedneſs; whence it doth not only perpetually raiſe a vitious Efferveſcency in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, but alſo in the ſmall Gut, and eſpecially the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas</hi> coming by fits being made too ſharp becauſe of its ſtoppage, and producing an obſcure fit.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The chief Cauſe of the troubles of thoſe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with an almoſt perpetual <hi>Coolneſs</hi> or <hi>Shivering,</hi> is judg'd by me to be the <hi>Lympha,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>all the Juice of the Pancreas</hi> peccant with a <hi>Sowr Acrimony,</hi> and then continually, driving forward <hi>Vapors a little Sowr</hi> out of the ſmall Gut every way, eſpecially at the producing of a new Fit, and ſo ſtirring up a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſenſe of Cold.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Cauſe and Reaſon of the other <hi>Symptoms</hi> uſually accompanying theſe Fevers, may be eaſily drawn from thoſe things that are ſpoken in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapters, ſo that it is not needful to ſtay lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on this matter.</p>
               <p n="11">11. So alſo the way of Curing Them is not hard to be taken from what is afore-ſaid, by following the Cure of Synochals in the moſt, and uſing moreover thoſe things in a convenient time, which will mildly looſen an Obſtruction in one, or more of the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Pancreas, and correct the Juice it ſelf hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto too ſharp.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The <hi>Opening of a Vein</hi> then chiefly conduces, when <hi>there is exceding Heat;</hi> and the provoking a <hi>Sweat,</hi> by mild Aromatics and Volatil Salts, when there are ſigns of a Sowr Humor any way trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; and laſtly <hi>Purging</hi> by <hi>Stool</hi> or <hi>Vomit,</hi> when <hi>Choler</hi> ſwells, or moleſts being plenteous.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> Of an Hectic Fever.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AN <hi>Hectic Fever</hi> is much ſpoken of among Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, in which, <hi>an Heat a little troubleſom to the Sick</hi> is perceivd, beſide <hi>an over-frequent,</hi> as alſo <hi>Little</hi> and <hi>Weak,</hi> and after a certain manner <hi>Hard Pulſe;</hi> which notwithſtanding is <hi>a little ſharpned</hi> and encreaſd, <hi>one or two hours after Meat,</hi> and again returns a little after to its former equality, and is <hi>perceivd to be greater about the Arteries,</hi> then the other parts of the Body: A continual and lingring <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Body following, wherby this Fever being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to its extremity is call'd <hi>Maraſmodes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Seeing that always <hi>a little after the taking in of any Food,</hi> and ſo the ſending down of their more fluid part to the Guts <hi>this Fever</hi> is more or leſs <hi>ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> any may believe and not without cauſe that <hi>a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table faultineſs of Spittle</hi> always concurr's to produce it, or that it depends on it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hectic Fevers are obſervd ſomtimes to ariſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from the <hi>Non-natural Things, too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Body,</hi> or <hi>continu'd labor;</hi> ſomtimes from <hi>moſt vehement Anger,</hi> and eſpecially from an <hi>immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Sorrow and Sadneſs</hi> of Mind: ſomtimes from Watchings long continu'd; often from <hi>too much Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> as alſo <hi>Food of little, or bad Juice,</hi> and ſuch-like.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yea Hectic Fevers are obſervd to follow other Diſeaſes, and eſpecially <hi>Fevers of one day</hi> proceding from a great error in Diet, and alſo <hi>Continual,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Fevers</hi> very dangerous or vehement; and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93060:169"/>moſt frequently the <hi>Inflammations of moſt of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtem's,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> following them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And ſeeing <hi>Heat is little</hi> in an Hectic Fever, and therfore rarely troubleſom to the Sick, and the <hi>Pulſe Little, and Weak,</hi> I judg that then the <hi>Liquor of the Conglomerated Glandul's</hi> is chiefly peccant, and not only <hi>Spittle,</hi> but the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas</hi> alſo, with an <hi>encreaſd Viſcouſneſs,</hi> and not a <hi>moleſting Sowr</hi> or <hi>Harſh Acrimony,</hi> although I have ſomtimes found <hi>this</hi> alſo <hi>grievous;</hi> Whence who can wonder or deny that <hi>Choler</hi> is alſo too ſluggiſh? and all may ſee that <hi>Lympha</hi> is likewiſe too much blunted.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And therfore I judg the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of a troubleſom <hi>Pining</hi> in an <hi>Hectic Fever</hi> to be <hi>too much Viſcouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all the Humors,</hi> and ſo of the <hi>Blood,</hi> becauſe of which the Nouriſhment of the Parts is daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhd: and the cauſe of the <hi>Sharpneſs</hi> happening one or two hours after Food is taken to be <hi>Spittle</hi> in like manner <hi>too Glutinous:</hi> by reaſon of which the more fluid part of Food deſcending ſooner to the Guts, and meeting with Choler is at leaſt in part opend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch-like Vapors and carri'd to the Heart, and there more rarefi'd, ſtirs up the <hi>Pulſe more frequent then is wonted,</hi> and being ſoon driven all over cauſes a <hi>little Redneſs</hi> in the face, and a <hi>mild Heart</hi> in the reſt of the <hi>Skin,</hi> and elſwhere ſtirs up other <hi>Symptoms</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the divers Conſtitution of the other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and Parts.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Appetite</hi> of all <hi>Food</hi> is diminiſhd, and at laſt dejected by the noted <hi>viſcous Toughneſs</hi> of all the <hi>Humors,</hi> to wit, without an external Cauſe, as too much Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Loathing</hi> of them alſo attending; and moreover their <hi>Fermentation, Separation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Parts from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nuſeful ones, Sanguification, Generation
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93060:170"/>of the Animal Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. is hindred and deſtroyd. Whence the Toughneſs and Sluggiſhneſs of Choler, Spittle, the Juice of the Pancreas, and Lympha is daily augmented, and ſo the Evil becom's by degrees greater, and at length incurable.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When an Hectic Fever is produc'd by <hi>too much Motion</hi> and over-long <hi>Wearineſs</hi> of the Body, then I think that not only the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Watry</hi> part of Blood is too much exhauſted, and therfore <hi>both Sharpneſs</hi> more inwardly united <hi>being made ſharper</hi> all the Humors are made too Viſcous, and all the Natural Functions as was above ſaid, are deſtroyd.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When an Hectic Fever ariſes from <hi>moſt vehement Anger,</hi> then I affirm a <hi>Sowrneſs</hi> is drawn to conſent by <hi>Choler</hi> then having an <hi>exceding Acrimony,</hi> and the ſame being made in like manner ſharper promotes the noted inward Union of both being Sharp.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When an Hectic Fever is ſtird up by <hi>Sorrow and an immoderat Sadneſs of Mind,</hi> then I think all the Humors become more Glutinous by the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas too Tart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. When an Hectic Fever is made by <hi>prolongd Watchings,</hi> then I think the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> being too much conſum'd, the <hi>Acrimony in either Sharpneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encreaſd</hi> their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> becoms <hi>more narrow,</hi> and all the Humors are bred too ſluggiſh and tough.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When an Hectic Fever follows <hi>over-long Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> then I judg that the <hi>Acrimony of both</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſd by want of Food aſſwaging both <hi>kinds of Sharpneſs,</hi> and furthermore a <hi>more compleat <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> being made the Humors become more viſcous.</p>
               <p n="13">13. When the ſame Hectic Fever happens by <hi>Food</hi> containing <hi>little mild nouriſhing Juice,</hi> then that coms to paſs that was newly mentiond, but ſlowlier.</p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:93060:170"/>
               <p n="14">14. When an Hectic Fever ariſes from the defect of better Food, or becauſe of <hi>Pica</hi> from the neglect of <hi>Food</hi> of an <hi>evil,</hi> to wit, Glutinous, or otherwiſe <hi>Fat,</hi> or <hi>Sharp Juice</hi> over-long us'd, then the Humors will be over-glutinous ſooner, or more ſlowly either of themſelvs, or by chance, as we have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaind at large.</p>
               <p n="14">15. When an Hectic Fever ſuccedes <hi>Thoſe of One Day,</hi> then its Original is to be requir'd according to the divers Errors of Diet producing them, as is newly explaind.</p>
               <p n="16">16. When an Hectic follows <hi>Fevers without Fits,</hi> then, when they take their riſing from <hi>vitious Choler,</hi> it is to be aſcrib'd partly to the <hi>Acrimony</hi> of Choler according to <hi>Sect. 9.</hi> partly to <hi>Medicins</hi> that <hi>alter</hi> it, if long and plenteouſly us'd, and ſo <hi>corrupting</hi> and <hi>thickning the other Humors together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. When <hi>Intermitting Fevers</hi> turn to an Hectic, then the <hi>Humors breed it that are moſt peccant</hi> be they more or fewer according to what has been ſaid.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Laſtly when an <hi>Inflammation gone into an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſteme</hi> of the principal <hi>Bowels,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>of the Lungs</hi> breeds an Hectic Fever, then the whole <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs of Blood</hi> is infected by <hi>Matter,</hi> and gets a <hi>ſingular Glutinouſneſs,</hi> which being communicated <hi>to the other Humors</hi> ſpoils them with the ſame fault and renders them unfit to perform the Natural Functions right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Although in <hi>Leanneſs of Body</hi> all the kinds of an <hi>Hectic Fever</hi> do agree, yet will the Cure of Every of them differ not a little according to the <hi>diverſity of Cauſes</hi> ſo <hi>diverſly producing it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Yet in General, becauſe of the hurtful <hi>Tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Glutinouſneſs of all the Humors</hi> thoſe <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins</hi> may be us'd, which mildly <hi>amend</hi> and <hi>correct</hi> it,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:93060:171"/>to wit, all <hi>gentle Aromatics,</hi> and <hi>Oily Volatil Salts;</hi> as they that cut, and alter every Viſcous Thing, and reduce it into its natural ſtate.</p>
               <p n="21">21. And ſuch are to be ſelected, as do moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to and agree with the <hi>Conſtitution both natural and preſent</hi> of Every Sick Perſon; which the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian may eaſily find out and know by the Medicins that help or hurt.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Take diligent heed in rightly governing and directing <hi>Diet,</hi> that I. the <hi>Air</hi> be moſt temperat ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally or by Art.</p>
               <p n="23">23. II. Let <hi>Food be of eaſie Fermentation,</hi> as <hi>Milk</hi> and that either <hi>Womans,</hi> or <hi>Aſſes,</hi> or <hi>Goats,</hi> or as now the cuſtom is, <hi>Cows,</hi> taken whilſt it is warm; <hi>ſundry Broths, Yolks of Egs, Fleſh of younger Creatures; Wheat Bread</hi> rightly leavend and bak'd; <hi>Beer</hi> not too ſtrong and yet fermented, <hi>Wine</hi> of good age and ſmall and diluted in a little Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. III. Let the <hi>Motions of the Mind</hi> be Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, eſpecially ſhunning thoſe things from which the Hectic Fever aroſe.</p>
               <p n="25">25. IV. Let the <hi>Motion of the Body</hi> be gentle, and chiefly, when an Hectic Fever is raiſd by its exceſs.</p>
               <p n="26">26. V. Let <hi>Sleep and Watchings</hi> keep a mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeeing here all exceſs is very hurtful.</p>
               <p n="27">27. VI. <hi>The wonted Emptyings,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe that are natural, and <hi>ſerve the Individual,</hi> if they do not weaken the Sick, and procede too ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ought to be promoted, and all the other to be ſhund, as all Effuſions of Blood, or in Women the Monthly Courſes, of Seed, and of Milk as ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="28">28. When an Hectic com's with or ſuccedes <hi>Fevers Without,</hi> or <hi>With Fits,</hi> then upon their account the Cure may be vari'd, according to the divers harm of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:93060:171"/>divers Humors differently peccant: all which may be ſeen in the former Chapters.</p>
               <p n="29">29. None can ever cure an Hectic following <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, Apoſtem's, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> and <hi>Fiſtula's,</hi> who beſide the Remedies newly mentiond doth not alſo uſe <hi>Medicins</hi> that potently <hi>cleanſe,</hi> and hence <hi>conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers and Fiſtula's.</hi> Among which the <hi>Balſam of Sulphur</hi> with <hi>Aniſe,</hi> or any other Aromatic <hi>Oil</hi> is not the leaſt effectual; as alſo all <hi>Medicins</hi> made of <hi>Antimony,</hi> that are <hi>more fixt,</hi> and therfore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promote Vomiting, or Purging. Among com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things all thoſe are famous, which have the name of <hi>Vulnerary Plants,</hi> and are us'd in Decoctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appropriated to the Cure of Ulcers, as well as Fiſtula's.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And now having exactly obſervd all, in which according to the manner of treating the divers Cauſes of Hectic Fevers agree or differ, the Phyſician will far more eaſily obtain his deſired end in their Cure, whil'ſt he has both obedient, and patient Sick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (which is ſeldom) and the Evil be not delaid to the laſt.</p>

               <p n="6">6. In Malign Fevers there is for the moſt part ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd a light <hi>Shivering</hi> to precede, and <hi>Heat</hi> ſoon to follow it, ſeldom great, commonly more gentle, ſo that the Sick ſcarce uſe to complain thereof. Their <hi>

From all which <hi>Symptoms</hi> rightly conſider'd, and compar'd with thoſe which are known by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience both to <hi>reſiſt Malignity,</hi> and <hi>overcome it,</hi> I judg the <hi>Cauſe of Malign Fevers,</hi> if not always, yet at leaſt is moſt commonly a <hi>Salt</hi> that is both <hi>volatil</hi> and <hi>ſharp,</hi> which will <hi>weaken</hi> the <hi>ſomwhat ſowr Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the Glandul's,</hi> and make it ſluggiſh, and of little force: whence the <hi>natural Conſistency of the Blood is diminiſhd,</hi> and therfore its <hi>Rarefaction deceivd,</hi> and often the <hi>ſeparation of the Animal Spirits</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and hence the other <hi>Symptoms</hi> above-mentiond are produc'd; according as that <hi>Sharp Volatil Salt</hi> is drawn <hi>with the Air</hi> by Inſpiration into the Lungs, and thence into the Blood alſo, or is ſwallowd down with <hi>Food or Spittle</hi> into the Stomach, or creeps in through the <hi>Pores</hi> of the Body or <hi>infects, weakens</hi> and <hi>ſpoils the Liquors of the Glandul's firſt,</hi> or <hi>them together with the Blood.</hi> And hence depends the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of divers Symptoms obſervd ſeveral ways in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign Fevers; as alſo from the other Humors found in the Body of any.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Blood therfore being leſs conſiſtent ſuſtains a leſs rarefaction, whence the <hi>Pulſe</hi> becoms is, it only <hi>Little,</hi> but mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="9">9. I think the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all Malign Fevers to <hi>come from without,</hi> and never to be produc'd by it ſelf in the Body from the Humors corrupted of their own accord, for it procedes from a Fire exceding ſharp, which is not in Choler.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Mans Body as well Containing, as Containd is defended and <hi>preſervd</hi> againſt all ſuch Malignity in a Volatil Sharp Salt by the frequent and moderat uſe of <hi>Sowr</hi> things, and eſpecially <hi>a little Tart.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> Of an Univerſal Languiſhing, as alſo of Swouning and Syncope.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SEeing that Chyle is made of Food taken in, Blood of Chyle, of Blood both all the other things containd in the Body, and all the Containing parts of the Univerſal Body are nouriſht and encreaſd, with good cauſe reſpect is had <hi>to the Blood, wherein both the Strength, and the Reaſons thereof</hi> are examind, weigh'd, and determind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therfore ſeeing the generation and firſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Blood of Chyle begins in the Right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart, and is finiſht in the Left, and the repairing and renewing therof more or leſs decaid, and here and there depriv'd of ſeveral parts, and therfore flowing back to the Heart, many Evils do neceſſarily befal Man even here by the intricate ill-affected Change which happens to the Blood in the Ventricles of the Heart: which among the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt themſelves to every one, and eſpecially to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians by the Pulſe being variouſly chang'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We deriv'd Fevers hitherto from the Pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſide Nature too frequent, as the only common, and proper, and ſo Prognoſtic Sign of all Fevers; there being other Symptoms diſtinguiſhing every one
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93060:174"/>of their kinds, and degrees from one another: The next thing now is that we may draw and in a few words explain other <hi>Diſeaſes from a Little and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Pulſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe Diſeaſes, which are obſervd various both by reaſon of the accompanying Symptoms, and diſtinct in degrees, are ſignifi'd in general by the names of <hi>Imbecillity, or Debility,</hi> in ſpecial by the name of <hi>Swouning, Ecluſis, Leipothymie, Leipopſychie, Apopſychie, Aſphyxie, Syncope,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We will not curiouſly inquire here into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of all theſe Words, ſeeing that words are as they are us'd, however many vex themſelvs and others; but into the Nature, Eſſence, and true Cauſes of thoſe Diſeaſes denoted in thoſe names, and in Practice giving trouble to Phyſicians attent on the Cure of the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Univerſal <hi>Languiſhing</hi> of all the <hi>Parts,</hi> and <hi>Functions,</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> is ſomtimes obſervd, either bred <hi>from the Nativity,</hi> or riſing <hi>after it</hi> by degrees and inſenſibly, or coming, or remaining after <hi>ſome Diſeaſe</hi> preceding. This they call <hi>Infirmity, Imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> or <hi>Debility;</hi> which has for its Companion both a <hi>Little Pulſe</hi> leſs then it ought to be, and <hi>Weak</hi> and more Languiſhing then ſhould be, and oftner <hi>more Rare,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>Intermitting</hi> once, or ofter by certain or uncertain Intervals, and ſomtimes more and more deficient call'd <hi>Miurus,</hi> according to the Paſſage of the Artery, and often <hi>Creeping</hi> or <hi>Wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Dulneſs of the Internal and External Senſes,</hi> and <hi>Defect of the Animal Motion of Body,</hi> known by the name of <hi>Wearineſs</hi> do uſually concur in this Diſeaſe when more grievous.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Weakneſs</hi> is alſo obſervd ſomtimes, not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93060:175"/>or continually perſevering, but orderly, or diſorderly, and ſo repeting ſomtimes at certain, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uncertain Intervals, one while lightly, another while grievouſly afflicting the Sick, the ſame return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one while ſooner, another while more ſlowly, unleſs it take away and kill the Sick.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If any would conſtitute two kinds only moſt different in degrees, and not unfit to the method of Curing this <hi>Imbecillity</hi> and <hi>Debility,</hi> he may point out the <hi>lighter kind</hi> by the name of <hi>Swouning and Leipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymie; the more grievous kind</hi> by the name of <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, Leipopſychie, or Aſphyxie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. In all <hi>Swouning</hi> the <hi>Pulſe</hi> is <hi>Leſs</hi> and <hi>Weaker,</hi> ſo that in its lighter kind it can ſcarcely be perceivd, and not at all in its more grievous kind. The <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>Internal Senſes</hi> commonly are both <hi>darkned,</hi> or alſo <hi>ceaſe</hi> to act. The <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Voluntary Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> alſo is <hi>weak,</hi> or <hi>none.</hi> And ſo <hi>Reſpiration</hi> it ſelf is found to be either <hi>obſcure,</hi> or quite <hi>deficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. For the moſt part a <hi>Cardialgie</hi> or <hi>Tickling in the upper Orifice of the Ventricle,</hi> or a <hi>compreſſion of the Heart,</hi> and <hi>Yawning</hi> uſes to precede and foretel a <hi>Swouning;</hi> and ſomtimes a <hi>Diſtenſion of the Belly, a Croking, or Gripes; Dimneſs or Darkneſs are before the Eyes,</hi> with a <hi>Giddineſs,</hi> and a <hi>Tinkling in the Ears</hi> accompanying, or ſuddenly following them; <hi>Stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and often <hi>Convulſive Motions.</hi> For it is to be noted, ſeeing that Swounings do not only <hi>differ in degrees,</hi> but alſo <hi>in number and vehemency of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> that it does not ſeize on all always after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When the <hi>Swouning</hi> is again <hi>looſd,</hi> and the Sick ſeem to return to themſelv's, then the <hi>Heart</hi> is wont to <hi>ſtir</hi> again, yea often to <hi>palpitate;</hi> and the <hi>Pulſe</hi> is not only felt by degrees <hi>greater,</hi> and <hi>ſtronger,</hi> but
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93060:175"/>alſo <hi>more frequent:</hi> and the <hi>External,</hi> together with the <hi>Internal Senſes,</hi> though never ſo Languiſhing as yet, being by degrees <hi>reſtor'd,</hi> the <hi>anxiety</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> alſo of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and other <hi>Symptoms</hi> are obſervd to be diminiſht, and at laſt vaniſh away; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that <hi>Wearineſs,</hi> and <hi>Tiring of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Body</hi> depart more ſlowly.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The moſt grievous, and ſingular kind of Swouning is the <hi>Syncope,</hi> in which the <hi>Sick fall on a ſudden</hi> as it were ſurpris'd with cold Air, a ſudden and almoſt unexpected <hi>Tinkling in the Ears</hi> preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; preſently there is <hi>no Pulſe nor Reſpiration</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd; which is proper to the Syncope, and moſt grievous Hypochondriac Suffocation: Mean while a <hi>cold and glutinous Sweat</hi> breaks forth; and <hi>all the Parts of the Body wax cold and pail,</hi> yea often <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin</hi> and <hi>the Excrements</hi> come away; ſo that they are more like dead then living.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Seeing all theſe Diſeaſes are <hi>manifeſted</hi> by both a Leſs, and <hi>more Languiſhing Pulſe,</hi> you may call to mind what we handled in <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. of the various Differences of Pulſes, and their Cauſes; whereby you may the eaſilier underſtand, that which is chiefly to be obſervd here, to wit, that an <hi>Univerſal Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,</hi> and a <hi>Swouning,</hi> and <hi>Syncope</hi> are the <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi> of the <hi>Vital Function,</hi> that is, next pertaining to Life.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Seeing therfore that in all the noted Diſeaſes the Pulſe is obſervd both Leſs, and more Languiſhing then is Natural, I think that their <hi>Cauſe</hi> is always <hi>Glutinouſneſs encreaſd</hi> in the <hi>Blood,</hi> and the other <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors</hi> ſeverd from it; and alſo ſomtimes an <hi>encreaſd Acidity in the Juice of the Pancreas, Lympha</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alſo in Spittle it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="16">16. When the Infant hath got ſuch-like Blood, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93060:176"/>ſuch-like Humors in his Mothers Womb from <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinous Seed of the Parents,</hi> or at leaſt by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Blood,</hi> then he will have an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bred with him</hi> often occurring in Practice.</p>
               <p n="17">17. When, though the Infant be born in health, the Man contracts ſooner or later an harm like it in the <hi>Blood,</hi> and all the <hi>Humors by degrees from the faultineſs of Diet</hi> often above noted, then that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Languiſhing</hi> is call'd <hi>Acquir'd,</hi> often obvious in Practice.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Laſtly when <hi>too much Glutinouſneſs in the Blood coms, or remains</hi> after any <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> that riſes not ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſpeedily, and <hi>of late not rightly Cur'd</hi> by the fault of the Phyſician, Patient, or By-ſtanders, then that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Languiſhing</hi> may be call'd <hi>Symptomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> too frequent in Practice.</p>
               <p n="19">19. I ſaid <hi>after a Diſeaſe not rightly cur'd by the fault of a Phyſician, Patient, or By-ſtanders;</hi> For the <hi>Phyſician may be deceivd and cure the Patient amiſs,</hi> eſpecially when he is blinded and conceited with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices not enough minding thoſe things that Help and Hurt, and had rather his Patient ſhould die, then he change his own Opinion, though never ſo errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and confuted, the condition of the Sick growing daily wors and wors.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Here alſo <hi>may the Sick be in a fault,</hi> when he doth not only neglect or deſpiſe the ſafe Counſel of a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Phyſician, but eſpecially is abus'd to his hurt by hurtful things.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Yea, alſo the <hi>By-ſtanders may err,</hi> when they are not only too indulgent of the moroſe Sick, but moreover diſſwade them from the beſt Preſcriptions of Skilful Phyſitians, inſtead of which they dare give them hurtful and forbidden things.</p>
               <p n="22">22. I added <hi>that too much Glutinouſneſs might come
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93060:176"/>to, or remain in the Blood and Humors.</hi> It <hi>Comes to the Blood,</hi> when Medicins that Thicken and Stuff the fluid and thin Humors are too much, or too long us'd.

               <p n="23">23. When <hi>Acidity is joind with Glutinouſneſs of all the Humors</hi> encreaſd from a great error in Diet in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors</hi> of any Glandul's, and eſpecially thoſe of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas, then either a <hi>Swouning,</hi> or alſo <hi>Syncope</hi> is eaſily joind to the <hi>

               <p n="65">65. The Symptoms therfore, which are wont to be common to each Diſeaſe are to be conſiderd, and diſtinguiſhd, from thoſe, which are peculiar to a <hi>Syncope;</hi> for a <hi>cold and glutinous Sweat breaks forth in a Syncope, but not in a Swouning,</hi> in which not ſo

               <p n="68">68.

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93060:181"/>not to urge the Sick ſo perpetually, as to infeſt them before the Swouning ſuddenly to follow; therfore we muſt acknowledg another Cauſe alſo, and that either deducing unactive Phlegm into act or produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Windy Vapors from the ſame; it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that a <hi>ſowr Humor</hi> is requird both to ſtir up and encreaſe the force of Phlegm, and to breed Vapors that cauſe Gaping; becauſe, eſpecially if it be <hi>a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tart,</hi> it will make <hi>the Phlegm more glutinous,</hi> which may produce <hi>the Senſe of Heavineſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> ſooner and more potently; and <hi>raiſing an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency vitiouſly and victoriouſly</hi> with <hi>Choler,</hi> as we taught you happend in the <hi>beginnings</hi> of the moſt of the <hi>Intermitting Fevers,</hi> giv's occaſion <hi>to Windy Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Gaping</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="70">70.

               <p n="71">71. We taught you 4. that <hi>Dimneſs</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs before the Eyes,</hi> together with a <hi>Giddineſs,</hi> and <hi>Tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Ears</hi> did often precede a Swouning.

               </p>
               <p n="72">72. 5. Laſtly we have Obſervd that <hi>Retchings,</hi> and <hi>Convulſive Motions</hi> do ſomtimes alſo precede Swouning.

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93060:182"/>what we have told you before of Gaping.

               <p n="73">73. And now we have declar'd the Symptoms that uſually precede a Swouning, let us alſo run over the others very notable which are wont to accompany It: Among which although <hi>a Pulſe Leſs, and more Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, or None</hi> at leaſt manifeſt to Senſe cannot be reckond the laſt, yet becauſe for that end we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentiond more of its Cauſes, leſt we do one thing twice, let us go on to the other Symptoms.</p>
               <p n="74">74. In every Swouning therfore the <hi>Internal,</hi> as well as <hi>External Senſes</hi> are drawn into conſent, and <hi>are always darkned</hi> more or leſs, yea ſomtimes <hi>they ceaſe from all their Operation.</hi> And that the reaſon of this wonderful Effect and Event may be more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, I would have the Younger Phyſicians to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (for Old Men, and ſuch as are Compleat in the Art of Phyſic need not mine information) That in every <hi>Giddineſs,</hi> which we told you did for the moſt part precede a Swouning, and eſpecially its more grievous kind, the <hi>Internal,</hi> as well as <hi>External Senſes were troubled,</hi> and after a manner <hi>darkned.</hi> And ſeeing that it is known by manifeſt Experience <hi>that the ſwift Turning round of an External Thing ſeen,</hi> or of the <hi>Body</hi> it ſelf produces Giddineſs, the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> in like manner being mov'd <hi>round, at leaſt confuſedly ſtird;</hi> why ſhould we doubt, when the ſame Spirits are in like manner mov'd, diſturb'd, and perhaps turnd round by Vapors in the Body very much mov'd and riſing up to the Brain, that <hi>the Senſes</hi> as well <hi>Internal</hi> as <hi>External</hi> are not only trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93060:182"/>and diſturbd, but alſo darkned, ſo that they ſeem to ceaſe for a time? For, if they then do any thing which is unknown to them, yet the diſturb'd and confus'd Mind, not being in its power keeps no Remembrance therof.</p>
               <p n="75">75. Theſe things being thus laid no wonder, if in a Swouning the <hi>Animal</hi> alſo, or <hi>Voluntary Motion</hi> be <hi>Diminiſht</hi> or <hi>Aboliſht;</hi> and <hi>Reſpiration</hi> it ſelf either <hi>Obſcur'd,</hi> or <hi>Deficient.</hi> For the Animal Motion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the orderly and perpetual, and alſo by the Will determind (as the matter and the various Diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) Motion of the Animal Spirits through the Nervs to the Fibres of all the Muſcles, or thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; of which Motions ſeeing neither can conſiſt intire with the diſtur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="76">76. But the <hi>External,</hi> and <hi>Internal Senſes,</hi> and <hi>Animal Motion will</hi> not only <hi>ceaſe for a time</hi> becauſe of the diſturbd Motion of the Animal Spirits; but alſo by reaſon of <hi>their Motion hindred or taken</hi> away; which may be, when they <hi>ceaſe to be bred and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Blood, becauſe the Maſs of Blood is coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and made unmoveable by any ſowr,</hi> and chiefly <hi>tart thing.</hi> For there is need to perform the Internal as well as External Senſes, and Animal Motion that the Animal Spirits ſhould be freely and plenteouſly mov'd to all their Organs; although it is eaſier to fancy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to pleaſure, then to point and demonſtrate ſolidly what they are, which peculiarly ſerve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senſes: Yet do we obſerve in any attent Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Mind that the Brain is intent, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Animal Spirits as it were to be ſpent and conſumd; which may ſo long ſuffice to aſſign ſome Organ to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:93060:183"/>the Internal Senſes, until all theſe can be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly conceivd by the External Senſes, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaind to others, and at laſt the Aſſent of every one be mildly compeld to have the ſame Opinion.</p>
               <p n="77">77. But let us yet confirm the propos'd Cauſe by thoſe things, which are wont to be obſervd, when a Swouning <hi>ends.</hi> For we ſaid that then the <hi>Heart</hi> was by little and little <hi>mov'd,</hi> and <hi>did palpitate.</hi> Therfore the Cauſe of Swouning was ſuch, as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Motion of the Heart, and which being <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> and conquerd, Motion is reſtor'd unto it.</p>
               <p n="78">78. If therfore we have given you the true Cauſe of the Motion of the Heart in ſhort before in <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. and in more words have explaind it in our firſt Diſquiſition of Fevers, certainly then the Efferveſcency in the Heart Ceaſing to Senſe, and the burſting forth of the Fiery Parts much Diminiſhd, and the Rarefaction of the Univerſal Blood Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and therfore the Deſir'd Motion and Pulſe of the Heart will be attributed to the Glutinouſnes, or Acidity of Humors confuſd with the Blood: which is then actually renewd, when at leaſt in part the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme force and harm of a Glutinous, or ſowr Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is corrected, or conquerd, and that by <hi>Choler,</hi> or any <hi>Aromatic Liquor</hi> mov'd to the Noſtrils, or rather pourd into the Mouth, or laſtly elſwhere out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly appli'd, and piercing to the Heart, or any other Fire, or Fomentation of the Evil.</p>
               <p n="79">79. For then not only the <hi>Blood</hi> again <hi>rarefies</hi> more and more by <hi>Choler,</hi> or <hi>Aromatics</hi> us'd ſucceſſivly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining rule over a Glutinous and Sowr Humor, but moreover <hi>Vapors</hi> or <hi>Wind are produc'd,</hi> by all which <hi>the Ventricles of the Heart are</hi> again <hi>Open'd,</hi> the drowfie and ſluggiſh <hi>Animal Spirits are ſtird up,</hi> and anon <hi>the ſame Veniricles are Foulded in,</hi> and ſo the

                  <hi>Blood has its Motion Reſtor'd, yea it becoms</hi> more <hi>ſtird</hi> and <hi>diſturbd,</hi> that is, there is <hi>a Palpitation of the Heart;</hi> of which in the next following Chapter we intend to ſay more.</p>
               <p n="80">80. Nor, is Motion reſtor'd to the Heart only, when a Swouning is ended, which moſt commonly is inordinate and with palpitation, but <hi>the Pulſe</hi> by degrees gets its loſt <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> and former <hi>Strength,</hi> although in the beginning it is alſo <hi>more Frequent:</hi> the Cauſe and Manner of all which is newly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="81">81. When the Cauſe of ſo many Evils is corrected and deſtroy'd by degrees, as was ſaid, no wonder if the other Symptoms alſo be eaſd by degrees, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; ſeeing that when the Cauſe is taken away the Effect ceaſes.</p>
               <p n="82">82.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> Of the Palpitation of the Heart.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Palpitation of the Heart</hi> is deſervedly referd to its Motion and Pulſe deprav'd againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I think is to be eſtem'd <hi>its Convulſiv Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> ſeeing it is indeed <hi>an inordinate, forct and often alſo vehement Motion of the Heart.</hi> For there is not always a notable vehemency, whence the Palpitation of the Heart uſes to differ much in degrees.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This inordinate Motion of the Heart may be manifeſted by the Pulſe of the Arteries in part and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:93060:191"/>after a certain manner, yet not plainly and fully; whence there is need, that for the moſt part the Hand ſhould feel under the left Pap: although in a vehement Palpitation of the Heart the ſame Motion may be ſeen, as alſo heard often at a notable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For it happens ſomtimes, that there is ſuch a vehement Palpitation of the Heart, and ſuch a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Ribs, that they are broken by it, or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth in younger and more tender People, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſticking out.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are alſo, as we hinted before, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the Palpitation of the Heart upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its greater or leſs vehemency; whence ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it will not be manifeſt unleſs you apply your hand to the Breſt; ſomtimes it is ſoon manifeſt to Seeing, and alſo Hearing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I take the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the Palpitation of the Heart to be, whatſoever <hi>is apt to ſtir it up to the inordinat, and ſomtimes alſo vehement Contraction of it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion;</hi> whether it be containd <hi>within the Ventricles of the Heart,</hi> or <hi>in its Subſtance,</hi> or it be <hi>without the Heart,</hi> yet continually pulls, bites, or pricks it for a time or always. Whence a certain Palpitation of the Heart is noted perpetually trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Sick, another urging for the time and again urging, or wholly departing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whatſoever is effus'd out of the Veins and E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lets into the Ventricles of the Heart, and is again ſoon expeld by its Contraction into the Arteries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coms ſomtimes the Cauſe of a Greater, or more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Pulſe, but not of Palpitation; to produce which there is need, that its Cauſe ſhould ſtick to or in the Heart, and continually provoke it to Contract
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:93060:191"/>it ſelf, which therfore will be both inordinat, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, and beſides together vehement.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now having examind, and weighed thoſe things, which I have both obſervd in the Sick trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a Palpitation of the Heart, and alſo ſeen noted of other Phyſicians, I judg this Palpitation of the Heart for the moſt part, ariſes from <hi>Humors, or Wind very Viſcous and together Sharp carri'd to the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of the Heart, and ſticking in them,</hi> and <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually provoking</hi> the Heart to an inordinat, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Contraction of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Theſe Humors, and Wind, may be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently carri'd out of the ſmall Gut to the Heart, whether they be driven forward <hi>of their own accord</hi> being mov'd by their vitious Efferveſcency; or being ſtird up are carri'd by a more ſtird <hi>Motion of Body,</hi> eſpecially in their aſcending a ſteep place, or a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>Paſſion of Mind,</hi> Anger, Fear, Sorrow, or Joy; or be in like manner conſtraind, or urg'd by <hi>an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſe</hi> as the <hi>Heat or ſharp coldneſs of Air;</hi> by ſweet or ſowr <hi>Food;</hi> by a potent, and that ſomtimes ſweet, other times ungrateful, or like <hi>ſmell of any thing</hi> to raiſe an Efferveſcency, and produce Vapors as well glutinous as ſharp, to be tranſmitted to the Heart.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Hence it is, that in the moſt kinds of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac Symptoms,</hi> the Palpitation of the Heart is ſo frequent, and familiar.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Hence it is, that ſo often about the <hi>beginnings of Intermitting Fevers,</hi> while Cold ſtill urges, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, as alſo in their Vigour, when the Heat is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, the Palpitation of the Heart is perceivd trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Beſide the noted Humors, and Wind ſomtimes there are obſervd <hi>Fleſhy Tumors,</hi> or <hi>Bone like</hi> or <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle-like
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:93060:192"/>Excreſcencies in the ſubſtance of the Heart,</hi> to which <hi>a Palpitation</hi> being joind till Death, was not undeſervedly aſcrib'd.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Worms</hi> found <hi>in the Pericardium</hi> by pricking the Heart, or <hi>a Sharp Humour</hi> by biting may be the Cauſe of an unwonted <hi>Palpitation;</hi> as alſo <hi>a Wound given to the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. The Cauſes noted in the two latter Paragraphs as they are difficult to be known, if not impoſſible, ſo neither can they be cur'd.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The moſt frequent kind of Palpitation of the Heart mentiond in the former place when the Fit moleſts <hi>may be Cur'd,</hi> if it riſe from Wind, by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicius that both <hi>Cut,</hi> and <hi>Diſcuſs,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per an Acid Acrimony,</hi> often propos'd before.

               <p n="1">1. THe Blood being perfected in both Ventricles of the Heart and the Lungs between is carri'd at laſt through the infinite Branches of the <hi>Aorta</hi> or Great Artery to all <hi>Parts of the Body,</hi> wherby <hi>They may be Nouriſht,</hi> and out of it <hi>Liquors</hi> farther <hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Flowing</hi> of Blood through the Arteries <hi>is deprav'd</hi> ſomtimes, either <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally,</hi> or in ſome Parts; and that 1. when <hi>it flows</hi> too ſlowly, or not at all; or 2. <hi>is mov'd too quickly, or too potently;</hi> or 3. ſo flows <hi>into the Subſtance or Cavities of the Parts,</hi> that <hi>it ſticks there;</hi> or <hi>flows out of the Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Blood flows <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally too ſlowly,</hi> or alſo <hi>is quite ſtopt and ſtands ſtill in its Motion:</hi> 1. in the <hi>Plethora</hi> call'd <hi>in the Veſſels, by defect of a ſufficient ſpace to receive the Blood</hi> perfected in the Ventricles of the Heart, and therfore alſo <hi>more rarefi'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. 2. In <hi>a Swouning</hi> and <hi>Syncope,</hi> as alſo <hi>a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Languiſhing of the Body,</hi> becauſe <hi>the Blood is not fit to rarefie;</hi> as was largely ſaid and explaind in <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſame <hi>Blood flows particularly more ſlowly through the Arteries,</hi> or is alſo ſomtimes <hi>ſtopt</hi> and ſtands
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:93060:193"/>ſtill becauſe of any kind of <hi>Straitneſs</hi> in <hi>the Arteries of ſome Part,</hi> and eſpecially a <hi>Compreſſion</hi> or <hi>Obſtruction;</hi> for I can ſcarce conceive that a Stopping Uniting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or Setling can have place in the Arteries.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Arteries may be <hi>Compreſt</hi> by an <hi>over-hard Tumor</hi> near them, <hi>by hard binding,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Arteries may be <hi>Obſtructed,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Capillaries</hi> both by <hi>Glutinous Phlegm</hi> carrid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Blood through Them, and either <hi>of its own accord</hi> or by degrees again <hi>cloſes,</hi> or <hi>coagulated</hi> by <hi>the Cold of the Air</hi> piercing thither through the Pores of the Skin, then <hi>compacted</hi> from the <hi>Blood</hi> It ſelf becauſe of External <hi>Gold,</hi> or a <hi>Sowr Humor</hi> injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf thither.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Blood is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally mov'd</hi> through the Arteries <hi>too ſwiftly,</hi> or <hi>too potently</hi> in all <hi>Burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> as well <hi>Continual,</hi> as <hi>Intermitting,</hi> as long as <hi>the Pulſe remains</hi> not only <hi>too frequent,</hi> but together <hi>Greater and Stronger</hi> for after that the Blood is then ſo far rarefi'd, that it diſtends the Veſſels too much, and makes a Plethora at the Veſſels, the <hi>Pulſe</hi> uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becoms both <hi>Leſs</hi> and <hi>Weaker;</hi> till by <hi>letting Blood</hi> by opening a Vein <hi>a greater ſpace</hi> is prepar'd <hi>to receive the Blood,</hi> and together the <hi>Vital Fire</hi> being near <hi>Suffocation is</hi> as it were <hi>recreated</hi> and ſtird up by the ſame means; whence <hi>the Pulſe</hi> alſo is then again both <hi>Greater</hi> and <hi>Stronger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. In like manner the Blood mov's <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally too Potently,</hi> and too ſwiftly in <hi>the Palpitation of the Heart,</hi> becauſe of the Heart as well forc'd, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to an over-frequent contraction of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The ſame happens after a notable, but not extreme <hi>Effuſion of Blood,</hi> and that either <hi>of its own accord,</hi> or artificial, or <hi>by chance,</hi> to wit, by a <hi>Wound</hi> receivd caſually or by force.</p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:93060:194"/>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>The Blood mov's more ſwiftly and potently to a certain and determind Part,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Blood effus'd out of the ſame,</hi> yet not in too great or high a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; becauſe, where this happens, the reſt of the Blood is carri'd thither, yea is ſo carri'd out, that by its defect the Vital Fire is diminiſht in the Heart, and the Blood deficient, and little, however rarefi'd there, can leſs open the Ventricles of the Heart, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can leſs provoke its Muſculous Subſtance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it ſelf, therfore the <hi>Blood</hi> is leſs driven every way, and at laſt fails, unleſs Life be ſpeedily helpt, after a Univerſal Languiſhing.</p>
               <p n="12">12.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVII.</hi> Of the Nouriſhment of all the Parts deprav'd, and in eſpecial of Atrophia, or Pining.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe general <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Blood</hi> carri'd to all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>of the Parts</hi> is their <hi>Nouriſhment,</hi> or repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Particles by degrees departing from them and periſhing; as alſo in Youth their <hi>Encreaſing</hi> to a decent bulk and bigneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Nouriſhment,</hi> and <hi>Eucreaſing</hi> of all the <hi>Parts is deprav'd</hi> ſomtimes either <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</hi> and that often according to <hi>the Fleſh of the Muſcles,</hi> and <hi>Fatneſs,</hi> ſeldom according to <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the</hi> Bowels, and Bones.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Depravation happens when 1. that Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment <hi>is Deficient</hi> in <hi>an Atrophie,</hi> or <hi>Pining:</hi> 2. when it is <hi>too Much,</hi> ſpecially in <hi>Fleſhineſs,</hi> or <hi>Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 3. When it is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nequally</hi> or <hi>Evilly</hi> in a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexie, Anaſarca, Leucophlegmatia, Rickets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In this Chapter we will Treat of an <hi>Atrophia,</hi> or <hi>Defect of Nouriſhment,</hi> in the following, of the reſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Nouriſhment of the Body</hi> is wont <hi>to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient manifeſtly,</hi> as is ſaid, upon the account of <hi>Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and the <hi>Muſculous Fleſh;</hi> and not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>of Griſtles, Bones, or the Subſtance of Bowels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. When <hi>Fatneſs only</hi> is conſum'd, and is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually repaird, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be call'd <hi>Leanneſs;</hi> when the <hi>Fleſh is together</hi> diminiſht, and is not reſtor'd, <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Neither is it a new thing to obſerve Men, whoſe
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:93060:195"/>Fat only decays; but ſomtimes alſo, thoſe whoſe Fleſh periſhes more, then their Fatneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This double <hi>Atrophia</hi> is often <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> through the Univerſal Body; but not ſo often <hi>Particular</hi> and in ſome determinate Parts only, eſpecially in the Lims.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This Atrophia happens often <hi>by the Fault of Blood,</hi> ſeldom by the fault <hi>of the Part affected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The Atrophia happens <hi>by the fault of Blood,</hi> when it <hi>is</hi> either <hi>deficient</hi> in the Univerſal Body, or ſome part; or <hi>is unfit</hi> to repair the Parts that grow lean.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Blood is Deficient in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Body,</hi> both becauſe of a voluntary, or forc'd Hunger; by any kind of notable <hi>Effuſion of Blood;</hi> by the defect of <hi>convenient Food;</hi> by too much <hi>Motion of Body;</hi> by <hi>Watchings</hi> too long continu'd; by <hi>permanent Cares;</hi> by too much and too long <hi>heat of Air;</hi> and becauſe of a <hi>Looſneſs prolong'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>The Blood is</hi> uſually <hi>Deficient in ſome Part</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>its hindred Flowing unto or into It,</hi> and ſo the Cutting or <hi>Compreſſion</hi> whatſoever <hi>of the Arteries</hi> tending <hi>to</hi> it, by <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njointing of the Bones, hard Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, Bonds,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>The Blood is unfit to nouriſh</hi> and repair <hi>the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Containing,</hi> and its <hi>Parts</hi> more, or fewer becauſe of <hi>a vitious Quality,</hi> or Vitious, Salt, Viſcous, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent, <hi>&amp;c. Humors</hi> mixt with it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The <hi>Blood</hi> oft retains <hi>a vitious quality</hi> after <hi>great Symptoms and Diſeaſes</hi> gone before, <hi>Burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the Dyſenterie,</hi> &amp;c. or as yet preſent, an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic Fever</hi> either <hi>ſingle,</hi> or <hi>Tiſical, Waſting,</hi> and ſlowly or ſuddenly conſuming the Body: Although I then think the <hi>vitious Humors</hi> are to be conſiderd, which <hi>produce</hi> the noted <hi>Fevers,</hi> and do moreover
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:93060:196"/>vitiate the Blood, and make it <hi>unfit</hi> to nouriſh the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, eſpecially <hi>Matter</hi> infecting and corrupting the Blood in a <hi>Tiſic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. We have in ſeveral places, and ſtill intend to propoſe in this Treatiſe <hi>the riſing of Vitious, Salt, Viſcous, Purulent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Humors,</hi> whence they may be ſought.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Pining happens <hi>by the fault of the Parts to be Nouriſht,</hi> when they ſuffer ſome harm by what <hi>Cauſe</hi> ſoever, and eſpecially <hi>External,</hi> and <hi>Accidental,</hi> to wit by a <hi>Chance, Contuſion, great Wound,</hi> &amp;c. whence the <hi>Veſſels</hi> carri'd through Them are not only <hi>burſt,</hi> or <hi>cut,</hi> but the <hi>Fleſh</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>Membrans,</hi> &amp;c. are waſted and vitiated wherfore the <hi>Blood</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>deficient,</hi> but the <hi>Food</hi> alſo coming to them is <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>The Cauſe of Pining</hi> which ſome ſeek or place in <hi>the Defect of the Radical Moiſture,</hi> or <hi>Inbred Heat,</hi> or the <hi>Inward Temperament chang'd into too hot and dry,</hi> I think is to be ſought, and found in <hi>Choler, Lympha,</hi> and alſo <hi>Spittle, and the Juice of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas</hi> not feignd and commented, and ſo Chimaerical but actually exiſting, obſervd by many, and ſenſible Humors, but after divers manners chang'd and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In <hi>an extreme Pining,</hi> beſide <hi>the Hippocratical Face,</hi> conſiſting in <hi>the Temples fall'n, the hollowneſs of the Eyes, the Noſtrils ſharp, the Chops giving out, and the Mouth gaping,</hi> the Ribs in the Breſt ſtands out, and <hi>the Griſtle</hi> call'd <hi>Enſiformis</hi> is ſeen crooked; <hi>the Sholder blade,</hi> and <hi>Collar bones</hi> appear like Bows; <hi>the ſpine of the Back</hi> ſhows it ſelf; <hi>the Belly</hi> appears fall'n, and contracted; the <hi>Buttocs</hi> are lank, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd; the <hi>Legs, Arms, Feet,</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> with <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> are beheld dry, and Swellings about the <hi>Joints</hi>

               <p n="18">18. All Phyſicians teſtifie, whom Experience fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that a <hi>Pining,</hi> eſpecially after it has continu'd for ſome time <hi>is hard to Cure,</hi> and oft-times <hi>Incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> although the moſt think that it is not hard to cure in the beginning, ſo that it be known.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Pining may be Cur'd,</hi> 1. <hi>by Repairing</hi> the <hi>

               <p n="1">1.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIX.</hi> Of a Cachexie, and in ſpecial, Anaſarca, and Leucophlegmatia.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Nouriſhment of the Body peccant in quality</hi> may, and is wont to be call'd <hi>a Cachexie;</hi> in which the <hi>Native Skin</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Colour of the Face languiſheth,</hi> and is chang'd <hi>pale,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>yellow</hi> or <hi>livid and very wan;</hi> as in ſome <hi>ſwart red,</hi> or <hi>ſomwhat rediſh,</hi> together with <hi>little Pimples</hi> riſing up commonly in the <hi>Noſe,</hi> and <hi>Cheeks</hi> of ſeveral ſorts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the moſt kinds of a Cachexie <hi>a Dyſpnaea</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur's, which is more encreas'd, when the Body is mov'd, eſpecially over-much, and in aſcending an high place. And then moſt uſually <hi>a Palpitation of the Heart, and a Pulſation of the Arteries about the Throat, and Temples,</hi> manifeſt to Sight, is produc'd. Commonly there is <hi>a Wearineſs of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Body,</hi> and <hi>Thighs</hi> eſpecially. Often <hi>a preſſing and vexing pain of the Heart</hi> urges, which uſes to be encreaſd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Food taken in. Yea for the moſt part there is <hi>a lingring Fever,</hi> and that either <hi>Continual,</hi> or <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,</hi> or <hi>Compounded of both. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin</hi> coms away often <hi>Crude,</hi> or <hi>Watry,</hi> ſeldom <hi>Thick</hi> or <hi>Troubled,</hi> unleſs they be troubled or chang'd by another Diſeaſe accompanying, or an External Cauſe. At length the Univerſal <hi>Body waxes Lean, and Pines</hi> in ſome; as in others the ſame <hi>Swels</hi> and <hi>is Turgid.</hi> And an <hi>Anaſarca</hi> comes by <hi>a Serous Humor;</hi> as <hi>a Leucophleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia</hi> by a <hi>Phlegmatic,</hi> and more <hi>viſcous Humor;</hi> and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:93060:198"/>
                  <hi>an Aſcites,</hi> from both, at leaſt the former, when the <hi>Belly with the Thighs</hi> only is troubled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A Cachexie</hi> ſpares none, nor People of any Age; although moſt frequently it ſiezes on <hi>Women</hi> becauſe of their <hi>Monthly Courſes Staying too long, and hindred,</hi> or any way <hi>Suppreſt;</hi> it is alſo often enough wont to accompany the <hi>Hypochondriac Diſeaſe,</hi> and its notable kind, the <hi>Scurvy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of every <hi>Cachexie</hi> is <hi>the Blood endued with a vitious quality,</hi> becauſe of which although the parts of the Body be a little, and for ſome time nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht, yet are they not nouriſht, as is requir'd; but their nouriſhment is deprav'd ſeveral ways <hi>according to the variety of the quality peccant:</hi> whence alſo <hi>more kinds of a Cachexie</hi> are obſervd, to be diſtinguiſht both according to the diverſity of <hi>Heat chang'd,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>of the Symptoms</hi> conjoind.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Quality of Blood is faulty</hi> both by the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Humors</hi> concurring to the Conſtitution of the Blood in the Heart, but having a vitious quality; and by the <hi>Non-Natural Things</hi> ſo call'd, vitiating ſome of the nam'd Humors, and Blood it ſelf, and ſo corrupting them, that an ill Nouriſhment of the Body follows.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Natural Humors,</hi> that are wont to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd with the Blood, and hitherto known, are <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and <hi>Lympha</hi> of the Conglobated Glandul's, and the other Parts of the Body, as alſo <hi>Spittle,</hi> and the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas,</hi> joind together with <hi>Choler</hi> in the Small Gut, and compounding a ſingular Liquor to be mixt with Lympha, and ſo the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> returnd any way to the Blood; all which I ſcarce think that any verſt though but a little in the Art of Phyſic, and addicted to the Truth can deny to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a vitious quality, and to communicate it ſelf with the Blood.</p>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:93060:199"/>
               <p n="7">7. We have noted ſeveral Depravations of theſe before, and ſhall yet relate more: whence they may be requir'd that make hither.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As ſeveral <hi>Depravations of Humors</hi> are ſomtimes <hi>by degrees</hi> &amp; inſenſibly produc'd in the Body, ſo the ſame are ſomtimes bred <hi>ſuddenly and ſenſibly</hi> by the <hi>Non-Natural Things,</hi> or others to be noted with the name of <hi>Poiſon</hi> peccant in a notable exceſs, and very much troubling, or corrupting all things in the Body.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Depravations moſt frequent and manifeſt are <hi>Acrimony</hi> both <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi>-like Pickle, and ſomtimes a <hi>Lixivial Salt,</hi> and <hi>too much Viſcouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>Fluidity:</hi> the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of which, <hi>and manner of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> we have often propos'd, and explaind before; whither we remit the Studious Reader, leſt being too oft ſpoken it be tedious to the Nice.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The <hi>reaſon</hi> of the mentiond <hi>Symptoms</hi> will eaſily be known to any that thinks oft, and weighs, that as oft as the <hi>Blood</hi> whence-ſoever hath been made <hi>Vitious,</hi> and producing a Cachexie; ſo often all the nam'd Humors, ſeeing they ariſe from the Blood, are alſo bred faulty; whence likewiſe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both the <hi>Appetite of Food</hi> is deprav'd, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over their <hi>Fermentation;</hi> wherfore <hi>Anxieties about the Midrif,</hi> and <hi>a preſſing Pain of the Heart</hi> follow as well before as after its being taken in.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But when part, or the whole Maſs of Food ill Fermented is driven forward through the ſmall Gut, the <hi>Juice of the Pancreas</hi> and <hi>Choler</hi> which are confus'd with it being alike vitious, do not only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the expected <hi>Separation</hi> of <hi>uſeful and unuſeful</hi> parts; but alſo here happens a vitious <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> of theſe Humors; yea often manifold <hi>Vapors, or Wind</hi> being raiſd out of that vitious Mixture do not only encreaſe the fore-deſcrib'd <hi>Anxiety,</hi> but carri'd to the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:93060:199"/>Heart do breed its <hi>Palpitation;</hi> and carri'd to the Lungs make a <hi>difficult Breathing;</hi> and driven every way breed the noted <hi>Wearineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. From the ſame Vitiouſneſs of all the Humors a <hi>Continual,</hi> and <hi>Slow Fever</hi> depends, in as much as they raiſe a vitious Efferveſcency in the Right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, among many other Symptoms they likewiſe make the <hi>Pulſe</hi> more Frequent then is wont, and ſo preternatural.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And ſeeing the Sick through unquietneſs often lay their Bodies bare that were coverd with Cloaths, it eaſily happens, that Phlegm being carri'd through the Veſſels of the Pancreas is coagulated there, and breeds an Obſtruction; by which the Juice ſtanding ſtill may be the Cauſe of a manifold <hi>Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and it will be ſooner, and eaſier, if the Body run down with Sweat, and the Pores of the Skin are open, or the Air be colder and ſharper.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin comes away Crude, and leſs Colourd,</hi> or <hi>Thick</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Humors</hi> mentiond <hi>over-ſharp,</hi> incorporating with the Blood, or <hi>Watry</hi> abounding, which diminiſh the deſired Efferveſcency, ſo that the Separation, much leſs Excretion of the Excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Parts, to be voided together with Urin, being requir'd and uſeful doth not follow. And as then all the <hi>Parts</hi> are <hi>ill Nouriſht,</hi> ſo the <hi>Skin of the Face</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Air and Sight before all others, gives ſigns of its harm by <hi>Heat</hi> according to the variety of <hi>ſeveral</hi> Humors moſt peccant.</p>
               <p n="15">15. When the <hi>Acrimony of the Humors</hi> concurs, then is it manifeſted internally with <hi>Pains,</hi> or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with <hi>Pimples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. When the vitious <hi>Humors</hi> abound <hi>together in Plenty,</hi> then ſeveral kinds of the <hi>Dropſie</hi> at length ſuccede; if not, the Univerſal <hi>Body grows Lean</hi> by degrees.</p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:93060:200"/>
               <p n="18">18.

               <p n="22">22. It is requir'd to the <hi>Cure of an Inflammation</hi> and <hi>Apoſteme</hi> following, that. 1. The <hi>Compreſſion, or Obſtruction of the Veſſels be taken away.</hi> 2.

               <p n="26">26. Hence it is, that often by one Sweat prepar'd of theſe mentioned Volatil Salts, or ſuch-like, given in ſeaſon a Pleuriſy, that is an inflammation of the Side has been moſt happily cur'd without opening a Vein, and letting Blood.</p>

               <p n="37">37.

               <p n="38">38. For when the Volatil Salt of the Sudorifics coms to the right Ventricle of the Heart, there the Blood rarefies more, and more potently, and does not only ſeek an out-let for it ſelf of its own accord, but provokes and forces the Ventricle of the Heart by di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="39">39. When that mentioned Power of Sudorifics coms to the place of Obſtruction, it attempts the Matter obſtructing be it what it will, and cuts, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuates, looſens, and makes it fluid; whence it is

The Generation of <hi>Matter</hi> being promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and finiſht by theſe or ſuch-like Medicins; <hi>Its Out-let is not to be delaid,</hi> ſeeing while it is preſent the Pain perſiſts, and being let out is diminiſht; and the Matter becoms ſharper by delay, and therfore more hurtful, and the Parts near it are more and more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by it, and ſo the Ulcer is made greater, and ſo more difficult to cure; chiefly when the Veſſels near it are corroded by that Matter being too ſharp, and ſowr naturally.</p>
               <p n="57">57. For the Apoſteme that is deep is ſeldom opend of its own accord, and not without a long time: wherfore, when Matter begins to appear ripe by the Softneſs of the part affected manifeſt to touching, as alſo Redneſs and Pain diminiſht, as oft as may be, the Out-let is to be prepar'd for Matter either by a ſharp <hi>Knife,</hi> or a potential <hi>Cautery,</hi> in the ſofteſt and loweſt place of the Tumor.</p>
               <p n="58">58. If the Sick admit of neither, or be delicate, or moroſe, endeavour to draw the Matter toward the Superficies of the Body, wherby the Skin fretted may be ſooner perforated by It; for which uſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plaſter often approv'd by me may ſerve, which</p>

               <p n="60">60. When there is much Matter containd in the Apoſteme, diligently beware, that all be not let out at once, but by little and little; becauſe otherwiſe the ſtrength of the Sick is not a little proſtrated. But when there is only a little Matter, nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that all may be let out, which is fit, and ready to run out; not preſſing it hard, nor long, which is familiar with many Chirurgeons, by which I never obſervd that the Sick get any good, but often much hurt. When Matter ſticks in a place remote from opening, or is only carri'd in a crooked paſſage to the place of opening, then may it, yea ought it to be forc'd out by a mild preſſure of the parts.</p>
               <p n="61">61. VI. A way being made and opend for Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we muſt now forthwith procede to <hi>Cleanſe</hi> and <hi>Conſolidate the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer;</hi> to which end ſeveral Medicins are wont to be given, all which I neither blame, nor carp at. I have often conſiderd with admiration the laudable effect of <hi>Balſam of Sulphur</hi> with Oil of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, Aniſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this caſe, incredible to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if a little of it be dropt in, or anointed on the Ulcer. For ſhortly after the generation of new Phlegm is ſo diminiſht, that oft by the help of this one Balſam I have in a few days perfectly cur'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Apoſtem's after Inflammations bred both in the Breſts, and elſwhere.</p>
               <p n="62">62. By this Experiment not a little to be eſtem'd, I judg the Cleanſing and Conſolidation of Ulcers following Apoſtem's to conſiſt in <hi>the Correction of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, and Corroding Matter,</hi> cleaving to the Ulcerated Part, and corrupting the Blood at leaſt in part that is
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:93060:208"/>apt to nouriſh it, and turning it into <hi>new matter:</hi> and this <hi>Matter</hi> adhering to the part affected <hi>is Corrected</hi> by the mentiond <hi>Balſam of Sulphur,</hi> chiefly by its <hi>Aromatic Oil,</hi> and ſo abounding with a <hi>Volatil Oily Salt;</hi> by which the Acid Spirit abounding with Matter, and daily corrupting the Blood into Matter is not only dulld, but moreover mitigated, and ſo amended, that the Blood flowing to it ſoon repairs the parts before conſum'd, and finiſhes the laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation.</p>
               <p n="63">63. What farther may be deduc'd from this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment to perfect Phyſic alſo in other things, let both Ingenious and Judicious Phyſicians and Chirurgeons weigh and judg.

               <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Blood affords Matter</hi> not only to nouriſh and reſtore the Conſiſtent and <hi>Containing Parts</hi> of the Body, but <hi>to prepare and repair</hi> the Fluid alſo and <hi>Containd Parts</hi> every-where.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For a <hi>Volatil,</hi> anon to be call'd an <hi>Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is Separated from the reſt of the Maſs of Blood</hi> in the <hi>Brain,</hi> and <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> as we taught in our IV Phyſical Diſpute <hi>Sect.</hi> 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which although it be not perhaps ſeen and diſcerned with the Eyes of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:93060:209"/>the Body, yet is it demonſtrated to the Mind by ſolid Reaſoning, and that manifold.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>Separation of the Animal Spirits,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd <hi>Generation</hi> of them is deprav'd 1. when there is <hi>None,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>too Little.</hi> 2. When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is <hi>too Much,</hi> or <hi>too Plenteous.</hi> 3. When the Spirits come <hi>ill Affected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I. If at any time <hi>No</hi> Animal Spirits be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, it ſeems not likely to me that a Man can live long, but I think he will ſoon die being deſtitute of Motion, eſpecially of the Heart, and Breaſt, and Midrif.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is manifeſt enough that the Animal Spirits are often ſeparated <hi>too Few</hi> from the Blood, and that ſomtimes <hi>by the Fault of the Blood,</hi> other-times <hi>of the Brain or Cerebellum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. This is by the fault <hi>of the Blood,</hi> 1. if it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains little of a Volatil Spirit in it ſelf,</hi> becauſe of <hi>ſuch-like Food</hi> us'd too long, either of its own accord, or by chance, or by force.</p>
               <p n="7">7. 2. If <hi>it adhere more inwardly</hi> to the Maſs <hi>of Blood,</hi> by <hi>want of the Fermentation of Food in the Stomach,</hi> or any other thing together taken that <hi>more intirely unites the Spirits with the Blood,</hi> ſuch as I judg every <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>tart</hi> thing is; whither alſo 3. among evident Cauſes, great and eſpecially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Sorrow and <hi>Fear of Mind.</hi> 4. <hi>Sluggiſhneſs,</hi> and <hi>Slothfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>reſt of Body.</hi> 5. A <hi>looſe</hi> Mind, and not buſied with any thing; 6. <hi>An over-long and deep Sleep,</hi> &amp;c. ſeem to contribute.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If we could attain, and conceiv clearly, and diſtinctly how, and by what means <hi>the Brain and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellum</hi> are affected rightly to finiſh the Separation of the Animal Spirits, perhaps we could with leſs
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:93060:209"/>difficulty determin, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aild it, when this Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is deprav'd and leſsned by the fault of it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Certainly he that granted that <hi>the utmoſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Brain, and Cerebellum was requir'd to be open and open enough,</hi> whereby <hi>the moſt ſpirituous part of Blood might pierce, and be</hi> as it were <hi>ſtraind</hi> through it; as I judge will grant <hi>that the ſame being more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact then is wonted is unfit for the mentioned perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>The Coldneſs of Air, Water, or Snow</hi> vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently affecting the head ſeems to confirm yea to prove this Cauſe; from which not only a Stuffing in the Head, but alſo a more ſparing production of the Animal Spirits uſes to follow. And as we obſerv the Glandules of the Brain are affected and thickned in a Stuffing of the Head by Coldneſs not always very great; ſo I think the Brain and Cerebellum are ill affected when the Separation of the Animal Spirits is diminiſht by very great Cold compacting its ſoft ſubſtance, and thickning and ſtraitning it in its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous paſſages.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And although I deny not that the Blood alſo tending to the Brain may be ill affected by an external great Cold, yea that it is ſomtimes clotterd then in its Veſſels; yet in ſuch a Clottering of Blood there will not only follow a diminiſht Separation of the Animal Spirits; but moſt of all the motion of the Blood hindred, and after that an Inflammation and whatſoever very grievous thing uſes to accompany ſuch an Inflammation in the Head; which yet is not always obſervd when the Separation of the Animal Spirits is hindred by cold: whence it appears that the Head, and Brain, or Blood found in the Head is not always affected after the ſame manner by cold.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:93060:210"/>
               <p n="12">12. And as <hi>External Cold</hi> (that is, that which produces cold in us, and is found in the Air, Water and Snow) hinders the Separation of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; ſo <hi>Internal Cold</hi> (that is, whatſoever being in us breeds the Senſe of Cold there, to wit in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Intermitting Fevers) ſeems <hi>in like manner to hinder the Separation of the Animal Spirits,</hi> whence they that are taken with vehement feveriſh cold are for the moſt part unfit to perform the Animal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea or any of the Animal Functions, which I judg is by vapors carrid together with the Blood to the Head breeding cold, and partly making the Blood unfit by its Tartnes to yield its Spiritous parts, partly compacting the external ſubſtance of the Brain, or ſtraitning its hollow pores, and ſo at leaſt in part denying paſſage to the moſt Spiritous part of Blood.</p>
               <p n="13">13. II. <hi>The Animal Spirits</hi> ſeem <hi>to be Separated more Plenteouſly from the Blood</hi> in Men vehemently, mov'd in Body, and Mind eſpecially with Joy and Anger.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this Separation of the Animal Spirits increaſd is to be ſought, and found ſomtimes in the <hi>Blood</hi> it ſelf, othertimes in the hollow <hi>Pores of the Brain and Cerebellum.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="32">32. To this end I commend this following Form.</p>
               <p>℞. <hi>Fumitorie, Fennel-Water, of each</hi> ℥ ii. <hi>Simple Treacle-Water,</hi> or <hi>any other Aromatic</hi> ℥ i. <hi>Sp. of Salt Armoniac</hi> xx. drops. <hi>Oil of Cloves</hi> iii. drops. <hi>Mineral Bezoard</hi>

               <p>Let the Sick take two ſpoonfuls of this Medicin, and expect a Sweat being meanly coverd; which he may facilitate, and get what he deſires, if he always take a little of it in half an hours ſpace, till the ſweat break forth: for then he may uſe it more ſeldom and ſparingly; uſing moreover a little of pure broth, or mixt with a little wine, whereby his Strength may be recreated, and made fitter to bear a Sweat longer. For nothing ſo much helps the Sick, as a Sweat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued mildly a while; which Experience hath oft taught me.</p>
               <p n="33">33. When <hi>the natural, and ſufficient Separation of the Animal Spirits is hindred by an Internal</hi> or Feveriſh <hi>Cold,</hi> or any other without a feveriſh fit often ſeizing on Men, then the deſired Separation of the Animal Spirits ſo uſeful, and neceſſary to mans felicity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored ſooner, or more ſlowly by ſuch a Sudorific, as is newly mentiond rightly us'd, the Sweat coming forth one while ſooner, another while latter.</p>
               <p n="34">34. For by the help of this Spiritous, and volatil, and alſo Aromatic medicin, or one like it the Vapors and Wind that produce the hurt and troubleſom Cold in man, and Srupidneſs of all the Senſes, and Dulneſs of Motion are diſcuſt.</p>
               <p n="35">35. They who let Blood while ſuch an external, or internal Cold urges, or think they can carry out
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:93060:212"/>the cauſe of the evil either by vomit, or ſiege, put the Sick into danger of life, or at leaſt of more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evils, as I have ſeen done oft by Men more verſt in reading Books, then in obſerving the Symptoms befalling the Sick, and therefore often hurting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs as well as others. So much can the Mind anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated do by falſe prejudices, and therefore unfit to weigh, and diſcern things equally.</p>
               <p n="36">36. II. An <hi>over-Plenteous Separation</hi> and Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>of the Animal Spirits,</hi> may be Diminiſht 1. by <hi>Laying aſide very Spirituous Drink,</hi> and in its ſtead ſubſtituting more <hi>Watry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37. 2. By <hi>enjoying by degrees more cold Air,</hi> ſuch as the mountain, or marine, eſpecially Northern, and Subterraneal.</p>
               <p n="38">38. 3. By <hi>leſs ſtirring and exerciſing the Body,</hi> and ſo giving it to quiet and ſleep.</p>
               <p n="39">39. 4. By <hi>freeing the Mind from all vehement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Joy</hi> eſpecially or <hi>Anger,</hi> and keeping it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſd, quiet and almoſt idle.</p>
               <p n="40">40. And becauſe all ſudden change is wont to be together dangerous, there ought to be careful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that the noted changes by degrees may happen in the noted non-natural things.</p>
               <p n="41">41. And as the more open Cavities of the Brain, and Cerebellum deſtind and ordaind to ſtrain through the Animal Spirits do follow the mentiond errors of Diet, we need not doubt, but likewiſe a Diet ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what contrary to the former may bring again, and reduce them to a natural, and laudable ſtraitneſs.</p>
               <p n="42">42.

               <p n="43">43. If any pretending Phyſician diſdain the name of a Mixture, prepare a Decoction after this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing form,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Let the Sick lying in bed, meanly coverd uſe often in a day 5. or ſix Spoonfuls of this Decoction, wherby if poſſible, a light Sweat may break forth, to eaſe the Sick.</p>
               <p n="44">44. By the help of theſe medicins the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will not only be freed from their Drowſineſs, but even the <hi>narcotic force</hi> bred in the Body either in length of time, or receivd in from without <hi>may</hi> alſo <hi>be corrected and at length overcomd,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="45">45. The Sick will be raiſd from Sleepineſs and Stupidneſs, uſually the companion of Drowſineſs by potent external Objects ſharply moving the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senſes, and mean while not hurting their organs. So a great Light ſhould be ſet before the Eyes; a ſtrong Sound ſhould be raiſd near the Ears; ſharp Smels applyd to the Noſtrils, Spirit of Salt Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, of Harts-Horn, and ſuch-like; alſo ſharp Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Salts ſhould be put into the Mouth; his Skin ſhould be rubd with rough cloaths; his Body
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:93060:213"/>ſhould be expos'd to the Fire, and heat of the Air, but not to Cold: ſeeing it is known that Numneſs is caus'd by External Cold. Yet does it not follow thence that Opium likewiſe producing Drowſineſs ought to be eſteem'd cold, becauſe the ſame effect may procede from ſeveral Cauſes, diverſly acting: add, that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi> is bitter, being of a fat nature, which they would have to be ſigns of Heat: which thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be treated in Phyſics, of the poſſeſſion wherof although many glory, hitherto have I found none, who after the manner of the Mathematics compeld the aſſent of thoſe that differd.</p>
               <p n="46">46. <hi>The Animal Spirits being too much ſtird and mov'd may be compos'd, and reduc'd to their natural,</hi> and <hi>mild motion,</hi> by amending, or removing the Non-Natural Things occaſioning too much motion: that is, by Changing the hot Air into a little cold; by Diminiſhing the uſe of Spiritous <hi>Food,</hi> and in their ſtead uſing, thoſe that may breed Phlegm a little tough; by Granting <hi>reſt to the</hi> weari'd <hi>Body;</hi> and by Cauſing a mild <hi>Sleep</hi> by <hi>Anodins,</hi> and when the Matter requires, <hi>Narcotics;</hi> by freeing the Mind from all anxious and biting <hi>ſolicitude,</hi> and eſpecially by reſiſting bitter <hi>Anger,</hi> and by gaining to the Mind a pleaſing <hi>tranquillity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="47">47. Muſical Sounds will mildly <hi>reduce the Spirits too much agitated to a decent, and compos'd motion,</hi> but <hi>Anodyns</hi> more potently, and at length <hi>Narcotics</hi> us'd prudently, that is, by times and in a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
               <p n="48">48. <hi>The Animal Spirits turning round may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into their order,</hi> the External Cauſes being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, and Internal Cauſes being corrected; laſtly, the Spirits themſelvs being brought to ſome reſt.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Let the Sick therfore <hi>ceaſe to look at Objects
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:93060:214"/>turnd round, more Remote, High, and very Low,</hi> let them ceaſe <hi>to turn round their Body:</hi> but rather let them do all their endeavour, to <hi>get Sleep</hi> by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins often mentiond in this Chapter, and elſwhere preſcrib'd in convenient forms.</p>
               <p n="50">50. When the turning round, and Giddineſs of the Animal Spirits depends on occult Internal Cauſes, without the noted manifeſt Cauſes, then <hi>the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and Aſcent of Vapors, and Wind</hi> are to be <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> or <hi>ſuffocated,</hi> or <hi>diſcuſſd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="51">51. <hi>Their Production is hindred</hi> by Medicins that <hi>correct,</hi> and <hi>leſſen the Humors</hi> peccant in <hi>Acrimony</hi> and <hi>Glutinouſneſs,</hi> often propos'd before.</p>
               <p n="52">52. <hi>Their Aſcent is hindred</hi> chiefly by Anodyns, and Narcotics often mentiond and commended.</p>
               <p n="53">53. <hi>They may be ſuffocated</hi> by a liberal taking De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions prepar'd of more mild and grateful Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics.</p>
               <p n="54">54. <hi>The ſame may be Diſcuſſd</hi> by Oils made by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation of the Seeds eſpecially, that are commonly call'd, and by Tinctures drawn by Infuſion only of any parts of Aromatic Plants with the Rectifi'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, or by a diſtillation following; adding both Syrups, and common Waters in a convenient quantity to make a more grateful taſt. Many of which Forms we have all over in this Book for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners ſake.</p>
               <p n="55">55. When <hi>the Animal Spirits with the Mind are troubled by a vain and panic Terror,</hi> then, as long as he is in his Senſes, endeavour, that <hi>that Lymphatic fear</hi> ſo often deadly to many, <hi>be turnd away by the weight of potent Reaſons,</hi> and <hi>Sleep anon baniſhing it be ſpeedily brought</hi> by any helps, and ſo by Narcotics themſelvs: for unleſs this be very ſpeedily, in a little time Phyſic will be late in preparing.</p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:93060:214"/>
               <p n="56">56. <hi>The Animal Spirits made impure by External things will not be purifi'd,</hi> unleſs they be remov'd; ſeeing that the cauſe, remaining, the effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.

               <p n="12">12. The Palſie ariſing by a cold Rain, whence the Cloaths are wet, ſo affecting this or that part, ſeems to prove that <hi>Phlegmatic</hi> and <hi>Watry Humors</hi> abiding about the <hi>Nervs</hi> may moiſten and perhaps ſo far looſen the <hi>Tunicles,</hi> or <hi>Membrans,</hi> and hence <hi>the Marrow</hi> that <hi>it ſlipping down by a cloſing,</hi> renders its Pipes unfit to let the Animal Spirits paſs through, ſo that ſomtimes one, ſomtimes more parts do more or leſs loſe Motion, and Senſe.</p>

               <p n="27">27.

               <p n="28">28. That a Trembling is ſomtimes produc'd by a lighter Irritation of the Nervs is manifeſt, becauſe that ſomtimes a Convulſive Motion follows it, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ends in it.</p>
               <p n="29">29. I.

               <p n="12">12. Seing it is hard to know that Stones are bred of Choler, no wonder if their Cure ſeems an unheard of thing to many Phyſicians. Yet becauſe, when Stones are found in the Bag of Choler after death, the the reſt of Choler is like lees, and abounds with dregs and excrementitious ſetlings; ſuch as I have oft obſervd ſent out by vomit; I ſhould think ſuch are to be feard, leaſt ſome part of Choler grow into ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whilſt the other turns into ſuch excrements; and therfore <hi>Medicins that diſſolve</hi> theſe <hi>Stones of Choler,</hi> as alſo <hi>that hinder any Concreſcency</hi> are then to be us'd.</p>

               <p n="14">14.

                  <hi>CHAP. XLVI.</hi> Of the Motion of Choler to the Gut hindred, and in ſpecial of the Jaundice.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat <hi>Choler</hi> in a moſt healthy ſtate <hi>ſlowe down to the ſmall Gut through its Paſſage of the Guts,</hi> is not only ſufficiently prov'd by the Fabric, and Structure of all thoſe Parts, but by Choler it ſelf found in the ſaid Gut, yea by the Excrements co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourd by it; that I bring not Arguments taken from the ſame Choler in a Non-natural or Preternatural State ſent forth bitter enough, and that plenteous enough by Siege or Vomit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Motion of Choler to the Guts is</hi> ſomtimes <hi>hindred,</hi> when it is <hi>more glutinous</hi> and <hi>viſcous,</hi> and therfore more unfit for motion, of which depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſpake in the former Chapter; or when there is <hi>a ſtraitneſs</hi> in the <hi>Cyſtic Paſſage,</hi> or in that to the <hi>Gut,</hi> becauſe of which Choler is mov'd with more difficulty, and ſo more ſlowly, and ſparingly through them; which may be both by <hi>Choler very glutinous</hi> glued to the ſides of the noted Paſſages, and alſo by the ſame growing together <hi>into a ſtone-like Matter,</hi> and in like manner adhering by degrees to the noted Sides. For it ſeems not impoſſible that that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal Men ſomtimes, which is obſervd ſo oft to happen to Cattel and Beaſts in the Winter Seaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The deſcent of Choler to the Gut <hi>may be wholly taken away by an Obſtruction of the Paſſage of Choler

               <p n="4">4. It is commonly receivd <hi>that Choler wholly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in its natural Deſcent aſcends with force to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe of the</hi> noted <hi>Obſtruction</hi> of the Paſſage to the Gut, and <hi>is</hi> ſo <hi>carri'd to the Blood,</hi> and anon transferd with it <hi>to the habit and ſuperficies of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and there <hi>breeds the Jaundice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And although I ſuppoſe the <hi>Jaundice</hi> may ſomtimes be raiſd <hi>by the</hi> foreſaid <hi>Obſtruction,</hi> yet do I not judg that that Obſtruction ſuffices to breed it, unleſs <hi>Choler then abiding in its Bag</hi> eſpecially <hi>get a new change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. And that I ſhould be ſo perſwaded, very many both Anatomical, and Practical Experiments move, and in a manner conſtrain me; which I deſire may be always conjoind, as oft as may be, by thoſe who deſire to do any thing profitable to Mortals, and ſo to Phyſic it ſelf in the Illuſtration of the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Natural, and Phyſical things. For it oft falls out, that ſome Anatomical Experiments ſeem to contradict Practicals, whence by their long compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon together, and an accurat weighing of all the Circumſtances, Truth the more happily and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly appears. But if this be neglected, our Knowledg is rather obſcur'd, and things now occurring to us leſs diſtinctly of themſelvs are the more confus'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I have Obſervd 1. in <hi>diffecting Icterical People that the Paſſage to the Gut, or that</hi> call'd <hi>Cyſtic was not always obſtructed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. 2. I have Obſervd, <hi>that the Excrements are not always pale in the Jaundice,</hi> although leſs dyed then uſual.</p>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:93060:231"/>
               <p n="9">9. 3. I have Obſervd <hi>the Jaundice</hi> oft ſooner bred, not only by a peculiar <hi>Poiſon,</hi> but <hi>by a grievous and unexpected ſorrow of Mind, then</hi> that any can perſwade either themſelves or others, that <hi>an Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction could be bred</hi> ſo ſuddenly from what Cauſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at length then preſent and acting <hi>in the Paſſages of Choler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. 4. I have Obſervd <hi>the Jaundice Cur'd by Medicins,</hi> and that <hi>ſoon enough, by the help whereof any</hi> (unleſs prepoſſeſt with Prejudice) <hi>can ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an Obſtruction could be opend,</hi> or ſo <hi>ſoon opend.</hi> To this number I refer <hi>Cows Milk boild with Hemp-Seeds,</hi> by the help of which only benefit I have cur'd ſeveral, and known many of the Common People cur'd: Hither I refer <hi>Sope</hi> prepar'd both with the <hi>Oil of Olivs, of Turneps,</hi> or of <hi>Whales;</hi> and in like manner <hi>diſſolvd in Milk and taken.</hi>

               <p n="11">11. 5. I have Obſervd <hi>many Infants born with the Jaundice, or the Jaundice ſoon break forth in them after Birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Seeing from theſe Obſervations it is manifeſt <hi>that the Jaundice may be produc'd without an Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Paſſage of Choler,</hi> it is deſervedly askt, what is, or may be its true Cauſe?</p>
               <p n="13">13. That this may be the more happily and eaſily ſearchd out, I will premiſe the commonly known Symptoms that indicate the Jaundice inſtant or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, anon I will join ſome others, noted perhaps by few.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>The Compreſſive Pain</hi> therfore <hi>of the Heart</hi> ſo call'd, <hi>moſt troubleſom about the Lower Region of the Stomach,</hi> is wont <hi>more frequently to precede, and alſo to accompany the Jaundice in the beginning Anxieties</hi> and <hi>obſcure Gripes</hi> concurring in the <hi>Right Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre,</hi> where both <hi>the Bag of Choler,</hi> and <hi>its Paſſage</hi> is.</p>

               <p n="15">15. <hi>The Excrements are uſually white,</hi> or <hi>of an Aſh colour,</hi> and not diverſly dyed by Choler, as at other times; yea the Sick have <hi>more ſeldom</hi> a motion <hi>to go to Stool.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="18">18. When the Jaundice inclines, ſomtimes <hi>a great itching</hi> is felt <hi>in all the Superficies of the Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. Among the External Cauſes I have oft ſeen <hi>the Jaundice</hi> bred <hi>by the abuſe of Spirit of Wine,</hi> and of other <hi>ſtrong Drinks,</hi> and the Dropſie <hi>Aſcites</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, for the moſt part <hi>deadly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. All which being rightly weigh'd, I think whether the Obſtruction of any Paſſage of Choler have place, or ſuch an Obſtruction cannot be feignd, <hi>that</hi> then <hi>Choler ſuffers a notable change, by reaſon of which it is mov'd and carri'd more fiercely and plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly towards the Blood,</hi> with which notwithſtanding <hi>it is leſs mixt then is wont to be,</hi> but only <hi>confus'd</hi> with it, and therfore it the eaſier ſevers from it, and not only joins it ſelf to the Skin, and External Parts, but to the Muſcles alſo, and Bowels, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and dies them of its own Colour.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For Choler being as it is naturally is mixt and imbodied not only looſly, but moſt intirely with the Humors occurring both in the ſmall Gut, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, and that ſo,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:93060:232"/>that it cannot be more ſeparated by them: which Union is by reaſon of its Efferveſcency inſtituted in both mentiond places with the Sowr Humor flowing there.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Becauſe therfore <hi>in the Jaundice that moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire conjunction of Choler with the other Humors, and according to ſome parts thereof a Mixture,</hi> as alſo that mentiond <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> ſeems <hi>to be requir'd,</hi> if not wholly, at leaſt in part <hi>hindred,</hi> let us ſee, wherein the Cauſe of both theſe effects, yea and the Cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Jaundice may be known, <hi>what is requir'd in Choler to perfect each Efferveſcency, and what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall it, as to diminiſh or remove it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. It is now known to all ſorts of Perſons, <hi>that any Efferveſcency happens between an Acid and Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Salt, or that which partakes of a lixivial Salt;</hi> and in as much as it partakes thereof.</p>
               <p n="24">24. And whoever ſhall examine <hi>Choler,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it as well with <hi>Sowr Liquors,</hi> as with <hi>Lixivial Salts</hi> of any kind, will eaſily ſee <hi>that Choler concurs to ſtir up an Efferveſcency by reaſon of its Lixivial Salt,</hi> but <hi>much temperd many ways in it;</hi> leaſt there ſhould be a potent and vehement, and ſo hurtful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlead of a mild and to Nature friendly Efferveſcency in the Body.</p>
               <p n="25">25. And if <hi>Choler</hi> has the eſteme of a Lixivial Salt in ſtirring up an Efferveſcency, let us go farther and ſee, how its <hi>Salt</hi> may be affected, that it becoms leſs apt for an Efferveſcency.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Again it is known by Experience that <hi>the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſharpeſt Lixivial Salt is moſt apt for an Efferveſcency;</hi> which ſame on the contrary <hi>howſoever dull'd</hi> becoms <hi>more, or leſs unfit for an Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27. Many <hi>things Blunt the Acrimony of a Lixivial
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:93060:232"/>Salt,</hi> and 1. indeed <hi>Oily and Fat things;</hi> which any Sope teſtifies. 2. Every <hi>Volatil Spiritous Liquor;</hi> which the Salt of Tartar volatiz'd with the highly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rectifi'd Spirit of Wine teſtifies. 3.

               <p n="28">28. <hi>Water promotes and facilitates</hi> the Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of a Lixivial Salt, if a little be joind to it; and <hi>it abates and allays</hi> the ſame, if <hi>much</hi> be poured to it.</p>
               <p n="29">29. <hi>Fire alone ſharpens and encreaſes the Acrimony of the ſame Lixivial Salt;</hi> whence how much the longer it is urg'd by the force and flame of Fire, ſo much the ſharper it becoms, and more convenient for a potent and vehement Efferveſcency.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And that we may accomodate all theſe things to-our preſent Buſineſs, and according to our Ability bring a clear Light to the Doctrine of the Jaundice enough obſcure, who ever ſhall attentively conſider <hi>Choler,</hi> will eaſily own <hi>that not a little of Oily and Fattiſh is mixt with it according to Nature;</hi> becauſe of which, as the moſt potent and effectual, and therefore that which doth primarily blunt a Salt Acrimony, the Efferveſcency of Choler either in the Heart, or in the ſmall Gut is never obſervd ſharp or great during Health.</p>
               <p n="31">31. <hi>That ſomthing of a Volatil Spirit</hi> is mixt with the ſame <hi>Choler</hi> any will acknowledg, who not only ſees that Nervs great enough are carri'd to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but moreover knows that it will be eaſily mixt with any thing; which would not be, unleſs a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Spirit were mixt with it in a notable quantity: for by reaſon of its Oilineſs accompanying a Lixivial Salt, it is more difficultly mixt with any thing, to which as oft as a Volatil Spirit is joind, it is more apt
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:93060:233"/>to mix with any. And therby the Salt of Choler is rendred more temperat; whence alſo hitherto its Efferveſcency is alſo more mild in a natural ſtate.</p>
               <p n="32">32. <hi>Somthing of Earth is found in Choler;</hi> yet not ſo much as many evilly think, becauſe they either work ill, or reaſon ill; otherwiſe it would be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="33">33. I cannot paſs by here with ſilence the groſs and hurtful error of certain Men in gaining know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of natural things by <hi>Chymiſtry:</hi> For they think all things, that are in natural things, are manifeſted by Diſtillation only, and that nothing is containd In them, that coms not off by Diſtillation; as though Fire alone, as ſome wrongfully think, were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and that Univerſal, which brings every change to Natural Things; which they who aſſert, do ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y fully teſtifie how little they are verſt in taking up Chymical Experiments; ſeeing that infinite changes occur, which cannot be deduc'd from the Fire, and not a few, that are advers to the Fire. Of which Matter I intend to mention more, if at any time God give me leaſure, and other neceſſaries to perfect that Work; whereby I may communicate in public the Science of Natural Things which I have ponderd in my Mind 36 years.</p>
               <p n="34">34. <hi>Such, and ſo great a Fire in mans Body by which the Lixivial Salt of the Choler may be burnt, and
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:93060:233"/>become ſharper cannot</hi> certainly <hi>be feignd</hi> by any of a ſound mind, no not in a ſtare moſt declin'd from that which is natural; ſeeing that, if any examin the matter rightly, the primary Cauſe of a more intens Heat that is in the body it ſelf in a non-natural, or praeter-natural ſtate is to be requir'd, and deduc'd from Choler.</p>
               <p n="35">35. I ſaid the primary Cauſe of Heat in the body, whether Internal; whereby I may diſtinguiſh it from any External Cauſe, which nothing hinders but that I may call it either common <hi>Fire</hi> kept in with any kind of fuel, or by the <hi>Sun</hi> by which that all the Humors and eſpecially Choler become more ſharp is known to every one.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Therefore as oft as Choler is renderd Sharper in mans body, and that in its proper acrimony to wit conſiſting in a Lixivial Salt, ſo oft that acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is to be ſought, and deduc'd from the External Heat ſomtimes of the Sun, ſomtimes of common Fire.</p>
               <p n="37">37. I ſaid in its proper acrimony, whereby it may be diſtinguiſht from the Accidental, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by an Acid ſharp acrimony mixt with it, which breeds Choler ſomtimes Green, ſomtimes Black, to wit as a ſharp Sowr acrimony is more, or leſs mixt with Choler, and conſtitutes a compound Humor although known only by the name of Choler.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Seing therefore among thoſe things, which are found in the Body, and may and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd to the Internal Cauſes, nothing occurs, beſide the <hi>Sowr Juice</hi> that may <hi>render Choler Sharper,</hi> it is alſo very evident, to what the <hi>Burning of Choler</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more celebrated, then underſtood, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaind ought to be aſcrib'd.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Theſe being ſo premis'd, we muſt further
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:93060:234"/>enquire <hi>To what eſpecially the unfitneſs of Choler in mixing, and intirely uniting it ſelf with the other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the Jaundice is to be aſcrib'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="40">40. That this may be more eaſily, and evidently manifeſt, conſider that the Jaundice is in a ſhort while raiſd by the biting <hi>of a Viper:</hi> whoſe Poiſon, becauſe it is wont ſpeedily to abſolv its work, is wholly to be judg'd <hi>very moveable,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſubtil,</hi> yea <hi>of a Volatil and Spiritous nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="41">41. <hi>The Jaundice</hi> oft enough <hi>coming upon drinkers of more ſtrong wine</hi> and eſpecially of its <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe of the neglect alſo of other more ſolid food, and chiefly when any <hi>ſorrow of Mind</hi> hath preceded, and remains doth ſeem to confirm, yea to prove <hi>that the Jaundice may be bred by a very Volatil Spirit too plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly mixt with Choler, and making it more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="42">42. So that it ſeems not abſurd or improbable to me, <hi>that Choler is rendred over-Spiritous when it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Jaundice,</hi> ſomtimes by the moſt potent and ſpiritous <hi>Poiſon of Vipers</hi> in a ſhort time, ſomtimes <hi>ſtronger Drink</hi> daily us'd, and for a longer time, and <hi>leſs apt to efferveſce with Acids</hi> conveniently, and hence <hi>moſt intirely to join it ſelf with the other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="43">43. But ſome attentive to this matter may ſay, If Choler may be ſo chang'd by the Poiſon of a Viper, or any other thing or too ſtrong Drink, that the Jaundice may be bred without an Obſtruction in the Paſſages of Choler, Choler will not ceaſe at leaſt to be carri'd to the ſmall Gut; from which although a leſs and weaker Efferveſcency with the Juice of the Pancreas happens there, why are not the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at leaſt colourd by the ſame, as it is wont to be in other cauſes?</p>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:93060:234"/>
               <p n="44">44. To which difficulty that I may give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I Anſwer 1. that in every Jaundice the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements are not equally white, and therfore leſs died with the yellow colour of Choler: whence I judg ſomtimes more, ſomtimes leſs of Choler is alſo mixt with the Excrements in the Jaundice, by which they are More, or leſs died.</p>
               <p n="45">45. I Anſwer 2. that in every Jaundice, Choler is not alike evilly affected; whence thus far alſo it may be mixt more or leſs with the Excrements, and die the ſame.</p>
               <p n="46">46. I Anſwer 3. That the Excrements ſhould be rightly died by Choler, there is requir'd a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſufficient Efferveſcency of the ſame with the Juice of the Pancreas, becauſe of which its divers parts ſeparate from each other, and having a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture are joind to the Excrements.</p>
               <p n="47">47. I Anſwer 4. If during the Jaundice Choler be more Spiritous, and volatil, and therfore more fluid and moveable, the ſame may more eaſily pierce out of the glandulous kernels of the Liver through its ſmalleſt Paſſages to the roots of the Hollow Vein and with the Blood to the Heart; chiefly, if the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Choler to the Gut being provok'd is more narrowly Contracted or ſomtimes alſo Obſtructed by the ſame Choler more ſpiritous; wherfore the aſſault being made to the Liver, Choler may perſiſt in the ſame, its ordinary, though great way, towards the ſmall Gut being neglected.</p>
               <p n="48">48. For it may come to paſs, that, if the Paſſage of Choler to the Gut be not wholly obſtructed, it may at leaſt be ſtraitned by Phlegm made more viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous chiefly after a grievous Sorrow, covering it any way; or the ſame Paſſage may be irritated to a more ſtrait contraction of it ſelf by Choler made more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:93060:235"/>and therfore turgid and effus'd out of its Bag; becauſe of which a free paſſage to the Gut is deni'd it, and therefore almoſt all of it is carri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d upward to the Liver through the Paſſage of the Liver, anon being carri'd with the Blood to the right Ventricle of the Heart may be efferveſcent leſs then uſual with the Deſcending and Lymphatic Blood, and therfore may <hi>be more confus'd, then mixt with the whole maſs of Blood,</hi> anon every where departing from the Blood may infect all the Parts with its colour, and render them leſs apt for a natural nouriſhment; wherfore either a Pining, or Dropſie may by degrees ſuccede the Jaundice, unleſs it be ſoon cur'd.</p>
               <p n="49">49. And although I do not think that an <hi>Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Paſſage of Choler is neceſſarily requir'd to breed the Jaundice, yet do I not ſee, why it may not ſomtimes occaſion the Jaundice, whilſt it is its cauſe by ſtopping Choler in its natural efflux into the ſmall Gut, becauſe Choler ſtaying there may be alterd, and if it be lawful to ſay ſo, may grow ſpiritous both with a greater acceſs of the Animal Spirit, and farther exaltation and attenuation of the parts conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p n="50">50. This even thence ſeems to be evident, becauſe that an exceding Anxiety is wont to be felt by many in that right hypochondre (before they have the Jaundice) where the inſertion of the Paſſage of Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into the ſmall Gut is obſervd to be, ſomtimes a grievous Sorrow, or the abuſe of Phlegmatic Food preceeding.</p>
               <p n="51">51. By Sorrow All the Humors are wont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glutinous and viſcous, eſpecially in the ſmall Gut, and indeed becauſe of the Juice of the Pancreas thereby made more tart.</p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:93060:235"/>
               <p n="52">52. But whence-ſoever Phlegm becoms glutious and viſcous, the ſame is apt to cover and obſtruct the Orifice of the Paſſage of Choler into the ſmall Gut, and ſo hinder the deſcent and out-let of Choler; wherefore a Narrowneſs will be ſtirrd up there by Choler putting forth its force againſt the noted Phlegm, and producing Wind out of it, whilſt the remainder acting upon it ſelf is attenuated, becoms Spiritous and at length ſtirs up the Jaundice.</p>
               <p n="53">53. From what I have already mentiond methinks I have found and deſcrib'd no improbable <hi>manner</hi> and account <hi>of the breeding of the Jaundice</hi> without a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Obſtruction of the Paſſage of Choler into the Gut, to wit the <hi>encreaſ d Thinneſs and Spiritouſneſs,</hi> and therefore <hi>unaptneſs of Choler to be rightly and enough</hi> efferveſcent; which I have therfore noted in Choler, becauſe it is obſervd then not ſo much to be mixt, as confus'd with the Blood.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Let us further ſee, whether the uſual and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted <hi>Symptoms of the Jaundice may be deduc'd from its fore-aſſign'd Cauſe;</hi> laſtly, whether <hi>its noted Cure agree with the ſame?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="55">55. <hi>The Cauſe of a compreſſive Pain of the Heart</hi> is the ſame, which I ſaid in <hi>Sect.</hi> 52. was the cauſe <hi>of Anxieties raiſd about the lower region of the Ventricle in the ſmall Gut, Glutinous Phlegm</hi> being there gatherd and in part rarefi'd into <hi>Wind,</hi> ſtretching open, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preſſing the Containing Parts.</p>
               <p n="56">56. <hi>The Gripings in the right Hypochondre</hi> are to be aſcrib'd <hi>to an Acid Humor of the Pancreas</hi> leſs bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſo more pure by Choler meeting it leſs, and putting forth its harm more potently, and pricking and griping the Senſible Parts.</p>
               <p n="57">57. <hi>The Excrements</hi> are <hi>leſs died</hi> then is wont both <hi>by Choler more ſparingly approaching it</hi> and by the ſame

                  <hi>leſs efferveſcent,</hi> and therfore <hi>carrying leſs of its dying parts</hi> to colour them.</p>
               <p n="58">58. <hi>The Sick have leſs motion to Stool</hi> by reaſon of the ſame Cauſe, and Choler leſs ſharp.</p>
               <p n="59">59. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine is obſcurely Red</hi> by reaſon of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and deeply colourd Choler mixt with it.</p>
               <p n="60">60. <hi>A different Yellow Colour ariſes in all</hi> but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt tender part <hi>of the Skin,</hi> ſuch as is that of the <hi>Face, Neck, Hands;</hi> yea in the whole <hi>Fleſh from</hi> the ſame <hi>Choler</hi> leſs efferveſcent alſo in the Heart by reaſon of its encreaſd Spiritouſneſs, and more intire Union of its parts, therfore leſs mixing it ſelf with the Blood, and rather only confus'd with it, and therfore adhering every-where to the noted Parts, while it flows through with it, and colouring them with its Yellow colour ſomtimes more pale, ſomtimes more obſcure, and ſomtimes inclining to green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="61">61. When the Jaundice declines <hi>an Itching is felt in the Superficies of the Body</hi> by reaſon of an efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency every-where raiſd again and ſomwhat ſharp va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors thence breaking forth, and mildly gnawing the ſenſible Parts. For it cannot be, but, that a more potent Efferveſcency, then was before, of Choler every-where at its meeting with the Juice of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas and Lympha, yea with the Blood it ſelf more ſowr then is wont (which I remember I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd in the diſſection of one dead of the Jaundice) ſhould be ſtird up after that it is corrected by the uſe of convenient Medicins, not only that which is in its Bag, in which much of it is Gatherd, but alſo in the Univerſal maſs of Blood, with which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus'd, as alſo with all the containing and ſolid Parts, to which it adheres; by which therefore Vapors ſomwhat ſharp may be raiſd, which being carri'd to
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:93060:236"/>the ſenſible Parts, and eſpecially the Skin do there cauſe an Itching.</p>
               <p n="62">62. What is afore-ſaid may be confirmd more by <hi>the Cure of the Jaundice,</hi> which is not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but rather haſtned, becauſe commonly <hi>a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexie, and Dropſie, or Deadly Pining ſucceds it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="63">63. The Cure of the Jaundice may conſiſt here in that 1. <hi>the more Remote Cauſes, Sorrow of Mind, the abuſe of Viſcous Food, or of Stronger Drink be remov'd. That</hi> 2. <hi>the Mean Cauſes, Glutinous Phlegm covering, or obſtructing the Paſſage of Choler,</hi> as oft as it has place, or <hi>any kind of Poiſon changing and vitiating Choler, be corrected and carri'd out.

               <p n="64">64. I. <hi>Sorrow of Mind</hi> is overcom'd and remov'd by rightly reaſoning about any troubleſom matters, and by confirming, and hardning the Mind to bear and ſuffer ſtoutly any adverſity.</p>
               <p n="65">65. <hi>The abuſe of Glutinous Food</hi> is by degrees to be chang'd, and in its ſtead other Food leſs Gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous is to be us'd; therfore Fiſhes and eſpecially Sea-Fiſh is to be ſhund; as alſo the extreme parts of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures: and ſomwhat Sharp and Aromatic Sauces are to be us'd, Muſtard, Horſe-Radiſh, and ſuch-like that correct Viſcous Humors; whither Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salts ſo oft commended by me are to be referd, and added to ordinary Drink, but moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to Wine, and us'd moſt profitably at Dinner and Supper; although they may be alſo taken at any other time.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſuppoſe this <hi>Motion of Choler towards the Heart is</hi> ſeldom <hi>deprav'd,</hi> that is, <hi>remov'd,</hi> or <hi>turnd,</hi> unleſs perhaps <hi>in the Diſeaſe Cholera;</hi> and why not ſo often therfore deadly?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLVIII.</hi> Of the Mixing of Choler with Blood in the Liver Deprav'd.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe ſame <hi>Choler</hi> which is thought by me to be ſent out of the Glandulous Knobs of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver toward the Heart <hi>ſeems firſt to be mixt with the Blood returning to the Trunc of the Hollow Vein through its Branches implanted in the Liver,</hi> wherby the Vical Efferveſcency between the aſcending and deſcending. Blood may ſo be more happily raiſd in the Right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This mixing of Choler with Blood ſeems to be <hi>deprav'd,</hi> 1. when it is <hi>more looſe and leſs.</hi> 2. When it is <hi>more intire and greater.</hi> 3. When it is <hi>unequal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſcarce think that there can be at any time juſt <hi>no</hi> mixing of Choler with Blood.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I. I judg <hi>that Choler is leſs and more looſly mixt, and ſo rather confus'd with the Blood,</hi> when it is <hi>very Spiritous,</hi> as in the Jaundice (of which we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſpoken in Chap. 46.) or <hi>very viſcous, or earthy;</hi> whence it will be more difficultly, ſlowly, and ſo more imperfectly and leſs united to the Blood.</p>
               <p n="5">5. II. I judg <hi>that Choler is more, and cloſer mixt with the Blood,</hi> when it is more <hi>ſalt and ſharp,</hi> and perhaps <hi>fatter:</hi> which ſeems to be confirmd by Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fevers.</p>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:93060:240"/>
               <p n="6">6. III. <hi>Choler is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nequally mixt with the Blood in the Liver,</hi> when it is not <hi>Homogeneal,</hi> but <hi>Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal,</hi> conſiſting of divers parts, ſome <hi>ſharper,</hi> ſome <hi>duller;</hi> which I think has place in the beginning of the Jaundice, and other caſes as yet not enough ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd; for we get different Choler oft enough out of the ſame Bag.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whilſt we here deſcribe Diſeaſes as yet not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough obſervd and ſearchd out by Practitioners, no wonder if their Signs be as yet uncertain, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other things therto belonging be even now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, which ſomtime may be found and determind by the diligence of others: mean while we commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate thoſe things, which we hope may ſerve the more happy Wits.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I. We gave you <hi>the Cure of Choler peccant in ſpiritouſneſs encreaſd</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 46. <hi>Sect.</hi> 73, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>The Cure of Choler peccant in viſcouſneſs encreaſd</hi> may be moſt happily inſtituted with a continu'd uſe of any <hi>more ſharp Aromatics,</hi> and <hi>Volatil Salts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Choler more Earthy and prone to be Lapideſcent may be cur'd with the dulcifi'd Spirit of Nitre,</hi> ſome drops of it being for ſome time oft in a day taken in Wine, Beer, or any other Liquor.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Choler too ſalt and ſharp may be Cur'd,</hi> ſomtimes by <hi>Oily,</hi> ſomtimes by <hi>Viſcous,</hi> ſomtimes by <hi>Spiritous,</hi> ſomtimes by <hi>Acid Things,</hi> but more mild: which ſeeing they differ much among themſelvs, the Phyſician will need prudence, that, according to the diverſity of the other Humors then being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Body, the moſt convenient Medicins be ſelected and us'd. Whence it is no wonder, if all Phyſicians have not always the ſame ſucceſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they uſe the ſame Medicins, but not at the ſame time, as neither in the ſame Diſeaſes, or
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:93060:241"/>Cauſes: whoſe determination depends on a Practical Judgment rightly adminiſtring every Remedy for every Diſcaſe in its own time, place, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Choler peccant in Fatneſs encreaſd may be Cur'd</hi> both <hi>by more temperd Acid;</hi> and <hi>by a more pure Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Salt</hi> of Wormwood, Carduus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a <hi>more earthy,</hi> Crabs-Eyes, Coral, Shels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo by <hi>Aromatic,</hi> but chiefly bitter <hi>Plants;</hi> and <hi>by them</hi> that are <hi>mixt of both, Salt of Tartar Vitriolated, Salt of Tartar</hi> remaining in the Retort after the Spirit of Salt Armoniac is drawn off, and getting an excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <hi>by the conjoind Spirit of that-Salt,</hi> and ſuch-like.</p>
               <p n="13">13. III. If the Sick be urg'd in ſhort Intervals by different Symptoms to be deduc'd from Choler and it only, and therfore it be very probably conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturd, that <hi>Choler is Heterogeneal and Turgid with different parts,</hi> great endeavour muſt be made in an auxious and dubious Caſe; <hi>that, the parts of Choler</hi> which harm Man <hi>being moſt declind from their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate, be correcied, and amended potently, and mildly;</hi> which is chiefly to be requir'd from the then moſt urgent Symptoms, and ſomtimes bringing ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Death in its firſt, ſecond, or third acceſs.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I wiſh therfore, <hi>that</hi> as many as <hi>profeſs the Divine Name of a Phyſician,</hi> (that truly <hi>Deviliſh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and therfore reproachful to Phyſicians, although in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>CHAP. XLIX.</hi> Of the Preparation of the Glandulous Lympha in the Conglobated Glandul's deprav'd.</head>
               <p n="1">1. EXperience confirms that <hi>Lymphatic Veſſels come from every Conglobated,</hi> but not ſo from the <hi>Conglomerated Glandul's:</hi> Wherfore I think <hi>that Lympha is prepar'd in them,</hi> and that partly <hi>from the more Acid part of Blood ſeverd</hi> in the mentiond Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dul's from the reſt of the Maſs, partly <hi>from the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits</hi> carri'd through the Nervs to Them, and <hi>mixt with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But although I think <hi>the more Acid part of Blood</hi> is the chief Matter of Lympha, yet do I not think that purely of it ſelf, but <hi>diluted with Water</hi> ſervs for this uſe: which then I at length call <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,</hi> when moreover another part of Blood being mixt meets the ſame, and renders <hi>Lympha leſs Acid, or Viſcous,</hi> and ſomtimes perhaps <hi>ſomwhat Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For as <hi>the Serous part of Blood</hi> is naturally <hi>Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:93060:242"/>yet in <hi>Belgia</hi> it is found <hi>ſomwhat Salt</hi> in the half perhaps of Men, at leaſt as much as I could conceive by taſting the Blood let out of healthy or Sick People; ſo it ſhould not ſeem a wonder to any, if in the ſame place alſo different Lympha be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd: For <hi>an Acid Spirit</hi> is very <hi>hardly ſeverd from a Lixivial Fixt,</hi> but more eaſily from a <hi>Volatil Salt;</hi> ſuch a <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> I indeed incline, to believe <hi>is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind</hi> in the laudable <hi>ſerous part of Blood out of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Choler:</hi> In which ſame <hi>ſerous part of Blood,</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>an Acid Spirit occurs</hi> to afford Matter for Lympha.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As therfore <hi>the laudable ſerous part of Blood</hi> may be in the Body, or the ſame <hi>may be variouſly chang'd</hi> by External Cauſes, <hi>Air, Food,</hi> &amp;c. or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, as, <hi>the Motion of the Mind, or Body, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> &amp;c. ſo alſo <hi>Lympha</hi> may be bred out of it ſomtimes <hi>more Sowr,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>a little Salt,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>more Diluted, and more Watry,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>more Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As again <hi>the Animal Spirits may be Plenteous, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. As laſtly <hi>the Conglobated Glandul's</hi> themſelvs may occur in the Body either <hi>Whole,</hi> or <hi>ſeveral ways ill-affecied;</hi> even ſo by the fault of them <hi>the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of an Acid Spirit</hi> from the Blood, or from its Serous part, and <hi>the Mixing of the ſame with the Volatil and Animal Spirit may be divers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Whence any may ſee how many ways various kinds of Lympha Vitiated may ariſe, all which to proſecute and reckon in order in a new Matter would be tedious, and perhaps impoſſible.</p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:93060:242"/>
               <p n="8">8. Let it therfore ſuffice for the preſent that we noted the Fountains of Lympha Vitiated, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the kinds obſervd in practice, and to have deſignd the manner of Curing them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Preparation therfore of Glandulous Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha <hi>may be Deprav'd,</hi> 1. When it is bred <hi>more Sparing.</hi> 2. When <hi>more Plenteous.</hi> 3. When ſeveral ways bred <hi>with a vitiated</hi> quality, <hi>more or leſs Sowr</hi> then is naturally, and ſomtimes <hi>a little Salt,</hi> or <hi>Glutinous,</hi> and if any more Depravations of Lympha ſhall be obſervd at any time.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Seeing that all Lympha is carri'd through its proper Veſſels, therfore call'd Lymphatic, to wit, its Thoracic Trunc ſo call'd to the Deſcending Blood, and with it to the Right Ventricle of the Heart, wherby it may there ſtir up a Vital Efferveſcency with the Blood Aſcending, and died with Choler, I even now ſuppoſe that <hi>Lympha</hi> is requir'd <hi>to be in a notable quantity and ſomwhat ſowr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. This <hi>Quantity of Lympha</hi> ought to anſwer in due proportion to its oppoſite, wherby a laudable Efferveſcency may ariſe; whence if <hi>the quantity of Lympha be greater,</hi> Choler will be oppreſt, and a leſs and weak Efferveſcency will ariſe, and the Pulſe will thus far be felt leſs; but if otherwiſe <hi>the quantity of Lympha be leſs,</hi> Choler will then be more eſſicacious, and the Efferveſcency of Blood greater, and the Pulſe will thus far be felt greater.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That which the greater natural quantity of Lympha doth, the ſame doth its <hi>encreaſd Acidity</hi> more potently effect; as its <hi>diminiſht Acidity</hi> doth the contrary.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Seeing theſe things are of great uſe in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſic, they are worthy to be attentivly weighd by all Phyſicians, and call'd into practical
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:93060:243"/>uſe. For ſo by little and little many things in the Art as yet moſt obſcure and confus'd may be illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and moſt commodiouſly explaind: to beſtow which benefit on their Friends, Selvs, and Relations, I heartily exhort all Phyſicians of excelling Wit and Judgment.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Good God! how oft are the moſt Learned, and Experienc'd Phyſicians puzled when a true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is to be rendred of a little, and weak Pulſe ſo oft obſervd unexpectedly in the Sick! how oft they fly to Nature oppreſt, or deficient, or to occult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or malignity, wherby open Ignorance is hid among thoſe that are ignorant of the Matter! From which darkneſs of hurtful Ignorance that at length a Health-giving Light ſhould ariſe to all Men, I have not ſhund according to my power to take huge and envi'd pains even in this Buſineſs; which forreign and ſucceding Phyſicians, will own, and mention more then my Contemporaries for Reaſons enough known to their Conſciences, and not unknown to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p n="15">15. If a more ſparing, or plenteous, more or leſs acid Lympha doth not a little change the vital Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency of Blood, no ſmall change likewiſe is to be expected from the ſame when a <hi>little Salt,</hi> or <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous;</hi> for thus far it may be hindred, whence a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change may happen in the Pulſe, and the Life be oft in danger.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>The breeding of more ſparing Lympha</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede eſpecially <hi>from a more ſparing uſe of more Liquid and ſomwhat Sowr Food,</hi> and <hi>Sauces,</hi> from which without doubt Lympha has its riſing.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Generation of <hi>more plenteous Lympha</hi> may be aſcrib'd <hi>to a more plenteous uſe of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. The Preparation of <hi>more ſowr Lympha</hi> is to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:93060:243"/>be requir'd from <hi>a frequent and oft uſing of ſowr Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or <hi>Medicins,</hi> yea <hi>Food.</hi> For if Lympha accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Nature be ſomwhat ſowr, if the Juice of the Pancreas according to Nature be ſomwhat ſowr, each Humor is neceſſary and uſeful to an happy Life, like as the conſuming of each daily, needs to be repair'd, which is to be done by Food; therfore Food alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it Sowr Particles, and thus far more or leſs Acid ſhould be requir'd; let none expect all Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity from Sauces, or Medicins.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Little Animal Spirit</hi> found either in the whole Body, or at leaſt <hi>carri'd to the Conglobated Glandul's,</hi> and therfore leſs tempering Lympha, and leaving it more Acid may be a cauſe why <hi>Lympha is more Acid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. The breeding of <hi>Lympha leſs Acid</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the <hi>ſeldom,</hi> and <hi>ſparing uſe of ſowr Food, Sauces, and Medicins:</hi> as alſo by <hi>the Animal Spirits abounding</hi> in the Univerſal Body, at leaſt <hi>abundantly driven forward to the Conglobated Glandul's,</hi> and there making the Lympha more mild, and leſs acid.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Lympha</hi> may be bred <hi>ſomwhat Salt</hi> by a more frequent, and over-uſe of Salt Food, or ſeaſond with Salt, or Pickle, or dri'd in the Smoak, as alſo of ſuch-like Sauces; with which many of the <hi>Dutch</hi> too much indulge themſelvs, being more negligent of laudable Health. Which Evil they who make a long Voyage by Sea cannot ſhun, being forc'd to uſe Fleſh, and ſuch-like ſeaſond with Salt.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The extreme parts of Living Creatures, to wit, their Heads, and Feet, and the moſt of Sea-Fiſh, if they be oft and much us'd breed <hi>Lympha more Viſcous;</hi> as alſo any Food devourd in too great quantity, and therfore not enough fermented in the Stomach, yea the rather therfore having an hurtful toughneſs, and
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:93060:244"/>making ſuch-like Chyle, and hence Blood, and anon the other Humors in like manner ſuch.</p>
               <p n="23">23. If any other Depravations of Lympha be at any time obſervd, their Cauſes alſo may without great difficulty be ſought out both from Food, and from the other Non-Natural Things more or leſs pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. Of which thoſe things which we have oft mentiond before, may and alſo ought to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd hither, wherby this Doctrine may become more evident.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Seeing it is not yet enough known what <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Conglobated Glandul's</hi> is fitted to breed laudable <hi>Lympha;</hi> I have nothing now to add of its Depravations.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The <hi>Figure of Pores</hi> undetermind and yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſing to its Authors, doth not ſatisfie my Mind deſirous of Truth, not only not prov'd by forcible Reaſon, but not ſo much as ever made probable by any by manifeſt Experience. For that which is ſaid by many of ſolid or dry things ſent through a Sive having Holes of a different ſhape, doth nothing urge as to liquid and moiſt things; but neither is it true as to ſolid Corpuſcles, which are carri'd equally through round Holes, if they be Spherical, or Cylindrical, or of any other oblong and round Form; that I ſay not now any Corpuſcles, of whatſoever Figure they be, may paſs through the Holes of any Figure, when they are leſs then them. But take or ſay for granted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to pleaſure I know not what Figures of Pores likewiſe feignd, becauſe determind by none in the Parts or Bowels of our Body, through which Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures according to all the parts of Blood, and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Parts of it fluid, and continually flowing through inſenſible little Arteries, and Veins ſome Particles may paſs through, more may be ſtopt in the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:93060:244"/>Paſſage, whether this be not to obtrude new Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeras, inſtead of things ſought out, to be believ'd by credulous Men, let Judicious and Ingenious Men judg.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Wherfore they who in things obſcure and hid from the External Senſes, do explain the changes made in our Body according to Chymical Operations evident to the Senſes, although even ſo they remove not all Difficulties ſeem to me, whom I therfore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to Philoſophize more aptly, and to the purpoſe in Natural Things: yet do they bring more Light to our Darkneſs, then the others, who, however they uſe ſenſible Similitudes, yet do not uſe ſuch, as do enough ſquare with thoſe things, which come to paſs in our Body.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And that I may candidly ſpeak, what I think and require in their Opinions they bind up Natural Changes into too ſtrait Bounds, whilſt they adher to Affections of Qualities alone, not enough weighing that the Affections of Qualities are far more and much different from the former, according to which the mentiond changes come to paſs in Natural Things. Whoſe Nature, Eſſence and Diverſity, yea manifold manner of acting of the Qualities, although it be very hard to attain to with the Senſes or Mind, and to explain clearly, and diſtinctly with other things, yet ſhould not Ingenious Perſons deſpair of the good ſucceſs, but rather try with importunat La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour this Matter as yet hid in many things, wherby true Glory may be given to the Inventor, and the Public Good be promoted.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Would God give me more leaſure then I have hitherto had, I my ſelf would try my Fortune now in mine elder years, not doubting, but that I ſhould detect and obſerv many things by this both great and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:93060:245"/>pleaſant Labour, which would prepare and make a more eaſie way for others proceding farther. For I now have ſome things, which for want of leiſure I cannot commit to Paper, and communicate them to my Neighbour. But theſe and many other things depend on Providence, and Divine Aid, without which we cannot, nor do perform any thing lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="29">29. And although, to return to my Matter, we have not as yet obtaind the exact Conſtitution of the Conglobated Glanduls, yet let us add a little of their Depravations, becauſe of which the breeding of Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha is oft, and not a little deprav'd. At leaſt we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend here to mention <hi>a Tumor, and Hardneſs</hi> as alſo <hi>Inflammation</hi> of them manifeſt to ſenſe, and oft to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether concurring.</p>
               <p n="30">30. <hi>A Tumor,</hi> or <hi>encreaſ'd Bigneſs,</hi> and <hi>Hardneſs,</hi> and <hi>Inflammation</hi> of theſe Glandul's appear to Senſe even in Creatures alive, (for after Death they may alſo be noted lying hid) both in the Jaws, call'd the Tonſils, and in ſeveral parts of the Neck, or in other places in no wiſe coverd with much Fat, or Fleſh, where their noted Depravations are known ſomtimes by Sight, always by Touching, or by the Senſe of Heat.</p>
               <p n="31">31. A Tumor of the Glandul's is to be diſtinguiſht from their Hardneſs, ſeeing that there may be, yea there is oft a Tumor without Hardneſs, and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without a Tumor: although Hardneſs is ofter joind to a Tumor.</p>
               <p n="32">32. The Conglobated Glandul's ſwell, both when they are nouriſht, and encreaſd more plenteouſly in the beſt ſtate, and when they heap together the Blood continually ſliding thither beſide Nature into their Subſtance: which is the eaſier diſperſt through it
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:93060:245"/>ſofter and more flaccid, then through the Subſtance of more firm and ſolid Fleſh.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Blood is collected beſide Nature in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated Glandul's becauſe of its Impediment put to the reflux, and chiefly an Obſtruction in the Capillar Veins, or Chanels of the Arteries, and interpos'd Veins, more frequently happening by Phlegm grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, more ſeldom by Blood coagulated.</p>
               <p n="34">34. For as oft as all the Humors and chiefly Phlegm, together with the Blood in the Body become more looſend and fluid, yea are more abundantly every way either by the Air hot both naturally, and by Art; or by Food, or Sauces either Spiritous, or Aromatical, or abounding with a Volatil Salt; or by the Motion of Body, or Mind, eſpecially vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Anger; or by Watchings; ſo oft coldneſs of Air, or Water coming upon them, or Food, Sauces, or Medicins actually cold being us'd, or otherwiſe endued with a coagulating force, or the Body being compos'd to much reſt, or an extreme Sorrow, or panic Fear unexpectedly oppreſſing Men as both Phlegm, and Blood is wont to be Coagulated in the other parts, ſo in the Conglobated Glandul's; whence they being made unfit for motion do ſtick in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or Chanels between, and ſtop the Blood flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, that it cannot go farther through the ways hindred, which being diſperſt through the next ſubſtance of the Glandul's diſtends the ſame into a greater bigneſs, that is, <hi>a Tumor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="35">35. The ſame humor if more nearly faſtned to the ſubſtance of the Glandul's, or becomes more ſolid and compact after the diſcuſſion of its more fluid and ſoft parts, breeds <hi>an Hardneſs</hi> in the Glandul's.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The nam'd Blood when ſtopt in its Veſſels and Paſſages, or effus'd out of the ſame into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:93060:246"/>of the Glandul's, breeds <hi>an Inflammation</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent enough, and apparent in the Tonſils.</p>
               <p n="37">37. As oft as the Conglobated Glandul's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about the <hi>Plexus Choroeides,</hi> in the ſide-Ventricles of the Brain and elſwhere are ill-affected, ſo oft a Stoppage in the Head uſes to follow; which urging the Lympha that is bred becoms ſowriſh-Salt, and ſuch is taſted in a <hi>Coryza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="38">38. Whence we may probably conclude, what way ſoever the noted Glandul's are then hurt, that Lympha declines from its natural State and Quality, and is bred ſowriſh-Salt: ſeeing that their internal Superficies and Skin of the Face corroded by it flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, not only through the Noſtrils, but being carri'd or diſtilling every way within the Body, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lighter, ſomtimes more grievous <hi>Pains</hi> are bred, to wit, as its Depravation is lighter, or more grievous.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Theſe Pains as they are commonly aſcrib'd to <hi>Catarrhs</hi> not enough explaind, ſo they are more truly deduc'd from <hi>Lympha</hi> deprav'd, as has been ſaid, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd out of its Veſſels, and finding or making a way for it ſelf by its Acrimony into the adjacent, yea ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times remote parts.</p>
               <p n="40">40. From the ſame Lympha deprav'd and more ſharp ſliding down through the Jaws into the ſharp Artery of the Lungs, and after an Excoriation by degrees breeding an Ulcer, <hi>a Tiſic</hi> moſt commonly ariſes deſtructive to the moſt, as being commonly neglected of all in its beginning, when it is eaſily Cur'd.</p>
               <p n="41">41. I do not now remember any other evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations of the Conglobated Glandul's, to which Lympha vitiated may be aſcrib'd a cauſe; otherwiſe,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:93060:246"/>if they be obſervd by me, God willing, I intend to add them.</p>
               <p n="42">42. As for the Cure of the noted Depravations of Lympha; if 1. <hi>Lympha</hi> be bred <hi>more Sparing</hi> in the Body, it may be encreaſd with a more large uſe of ſomwhat-Sowr Food and Sauces. To this end Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juice, Vinegar, Juice of Citron, of Oranges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be us'd in Sauces. Among more grateful Fruits Cheries both ſweetiſh-ſowr, and more ſowr Curran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, Barberries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Among Plants Sorrel, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorrel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Among Drinks Wine of the Meuſe, or any other ſomwhat ſowr, yet of good age. For new Wines ſhould be ſhund, as alſo very tart Beer, ſeeing that Gripes are raiſd by them. Among the more Phyſical things, Spirit of Salt, and of Nitre, each dulcifi'd are convenient, being us'd with ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Drink.</p>
               <p n="43">43. If 2. on the contrary <hi>Lympha</hi> be bred <hi>more Plenteous</hi> in the Body, the Uſe of ſomwhat-ſowr Food, and Sauces muſt be diminiſhd, and in their ſtead ſomtimes more Spiritous, ſomtimes more Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſomtimes more Aromatical Food, and Sauces and abounding with a Volatil Salt muſt be us'd as the Matter requires, that is, according to the ſingular diverſity of Conſtitutions and Functions.</p>
               <p n="44">44. If 3. <hi>Lympha</hi> be bred <hi>more Sowr</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated Glandul's, its exceding Sowrneſs ſhould be leſſend and temperd rather, yea the Generation of it more Temperd ſhould be procur'd chiefly by the Uſe of Volatil Salts prepar'd in a liquid Form, and taken together with the other Food daily in a mean quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
               <p n="45">45. More Volatil Salts, both Single, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, may be us'd to this end according as the Induſtry and Felicity of Any ſhall be greater or leſs.
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:93060:247"/>For the mentiond Salts differ very much among themſelvs both by reaſon of their Matter, and alſo manifold Preparation.</p>
               <p n="46">46. If any want the convenience of preparing Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salts themſelvs, and ſo of inquiring into more grateful and efficacious Salts, let them uſe the Spirit of Salt Armoniac either pure, or mixt with other things, which the Sick may take to more, or fewer drops in Wine, Beer, or any other Liquor at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Supper-time, and may continue for ſome time in the daily uſe of the ſame, till the ill Effects of more Sowr Lympha be wholly remov'd, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comd.</p>
               <p n="47">47. If the Sick had rather uſe his ordinary Drink more pure, and the Volatil Salt rather in a Phyſical Mixture: the next Form or one like it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd for him, and let him take a Spoonful of this <hi>Mixture</hi> oft in a day, even ſoon before or after Meat taken in.</p>

               <p n="48">48. If 4. <hi>Lympha</hi> be bred <hi>leſs ſowr,</hi> its acidity may be encreaſd by Sauces, or Medicins that have a notable acidity, and us'd in a large plenty, as, more ſharp Vinegar, Juice of Citrons, and Sowr Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats; the Spirit of Salt, Vitriol, and of Nitre.

               <p n="49">49. And becauſe Fools, while they ſhun one Vice, run into its contrary, and an abuſe may eaſily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the over-uſe of Acids, whither moſt Men are

               <p n="50">50. When the Acidity of Lympha is diminiſht and broken <hi>by the over-uſe of Spiritous Things,</hi> then their uſe is to be diminiſht by degrees, wherby the Acidity of Lympha will become more pure, and ſharper.</p>
               <p n="51">51. If 5. <hi>Lympha</hi> be <hi>ſomwhat Salt;</hi> abſtain from the daily uſe of Salt, or ſalted Food; which is to be tri'd by little and little, ſeeing that the moſt who are addicted to ſalted Meat are very hardly remov'd from their purpoſe, and evil Cuſtom, which is as a Law.</p>

                  </gap>nd from other parts; with which it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd goes forward through the ſame Lymphatic Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to the Paſſage Common to Lympha, and Chyle, and through the Univerſal Thorax placed at the Spine of the Back, and therfore call'd <hi>Thoracic,</hi> till at length all be unloaden into the left Jugular, or Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illar Vein, where being joind to the Blood, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends with it through the upper Hollow Vein to the Right Ventricle of the Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This natural <hi>Motion of Lympha</hi> through the Lymphatic Veſſels, and Thoracic Paſſage may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd, 1. When <hi>it is wholly,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain manner hindred.</hi> 2. When <hi>Lympha moves in another way, and to another place</hi> then towards the mentiond-Veins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If <hi>the Motion of Lympha through the Thoracic Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage be</hi> at any time <hi>wholly hindred,</hi> I judg the Sick can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live long after it.</p>
               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:93060:249"/>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Motion of Lympha</hi> through more, or few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Lymphatic Veſſeis</hi> may be <hi>wholly hindred</hi> chiefly becauſe of their <hi>Obſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This <hi>Obſtruction</hi> may procede from <hi>Glutinous Phlegm</hi> carri'd together with Lympha through the Veſſels of the ſame, and growing together and <hi>Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated</hi> in them, and therfore ſticking in them, and anon filling them up.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Glutinous Phlegm is wont to be carri'd through the Lymphatic Veſſels, as oft as it eſpecially that was in the ſmall Gut is looſend or diſſolvd by any kind of the heat of Air, or a more vehement Motion of Body, or Spiritous, or Watry Drink chiefly warm, or hot, plenteouſly ſwill'd, being 1ſt of all confus'd with the Blood through the Lacteal Veins, and anon the Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racic Paſſage, and afterward driven forward toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it every way, therfore alſo to the Conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated Glandul's, and hence to the Lymphatic Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſame <hi>Phlegm</hi> is wont to be <hi>Coagulated</hi> in the <hi>Lymphatic Veſſels</hi> more frequently by External <hi>Cold, Air, Rain, Water,</hi> or <hi>Snow</hi> alſo any way affecting the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Body with troubleſom Cold, and together Coagulating any fluid thing eaſily Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulable in it in any place and forcing it to grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I dare not aſſert nor deny whether or no as Blood ſo Phlegm doth Coagulate by a great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Sorrow or Terror; although it ſeems leſs probable to me.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The <hi>Motion of Lympha</hi> through the Lymphatic Veſſels <hi>is hindred after a certain manner;</hi> both, when it is <hi>more Glutinous,</hi> and therfore more ſlow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for motion, and, when thoſe <hi>Veſſels</hi> are <hi>in part preſt,</hi> or <hi>ſtraitned</hi> any other way.</p>
               <pb n="452" facs="tcp:93060:250"/>
               <p n="10">10. As oft as <hi>Lympha</hi> ſtands ſtill <hi>in</hi> its <hi>Obſtructed Veſſels</hi> and being more, and more gatherd <hi>diſtends them</hi> and at length <hi>burſts</hi> them, ſo oft the ſame is pourd out into <hi>the next Places,</hi> or <hi>Cavities near them,</hi> and then <hi>Lympha is mov'd another way and to another place</hi> then it ought.</p>
               <p n="11">11. By this <hi>Effuſion of Lympha through its Veſſels diſtributed in the habit of the Body</hi> and obſtructed, then burſt <hi>into the next parts,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Pains</hi> and alſo <hi>Tumors</hi> are bred, commonly aſcrib'd to <hi>Catarrhs:</hi> Amongſt which they are not the leaſt, which poſſeſs the upper part of the arm to the very ſhoulder, and ſomtimes alſo afflict the Neck; to which alſo they are to be referd, that reſemble the <hi>Sciatica</hi> which remaining in the Buttocks hinder walking.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Some of theſe pains endure the parts affected to be coverd with ſeveral Cloaths, and be warmd by them; others are imbitterd by cloaths: whence they are more difficulty Cur'd, then the former.</p>
               <p n="13">13. They commonly ariſe from External Cold piercing into thoſe parts firſt warm till they Sweat and oft laid bare in ſleep, and producing various Pains, yielding only to divers Medicins according to the diverſity of Lympha after Phleam is Coagulated in the Veſſels of Lympha, and an Obſtruction, anon a Burſting made in them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For the Lympha which is more Sowr breeds pains more corroding, which may be allaid by Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Oils and Ointments; but that which is more Salt like pickle, ſtirs up pains yielding to oils and ointments leſs aromatical, ſuch as is the ointment of Poplars.</p>
               <p n="15">15. By this effuſion of <hi>Lympha</hi> out of the lateral Lymphatic Veſſels obſtructed, and anon burſt, and piercing into the cavity of the Breſt through the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:93060:250"/>membrane that covers the ribs I judg <hi>the Dropſy of the Breſt</hi> ariſes moſt commonly, if not always.</p>
               <p n="16">16. An <hi>Obſtruction of the Lymphatic Veſſels</hi> in the more inward parts of the Breſt <hi>may be prevented,</hi> by bewaring 1. that the body do not wax too hot; and if this cannot be ſhund, 2. that the Breſt being made bare it do not ſoon cool, and conſequently Phlegm grow not together nor coagulate being diſſolvd and every way diffus'd potently in ſeveral, and therfore in the Lymphatic Veſſels.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The ſame <hi>Obſtruction may be Cur'd,</hi> if as ſoon as may be, when its mentiond Cauſes have had place, and there is danger, leaſt the noted evil be bred, <hi>an attenuating and cutting Medicin</hi> be taken together and at once, or at times, ſuch as Sundry Treacle Waters made with the ſpirit of wine eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as alſo other Aromatics do afford; <hi>Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> prepar'd <hi>of the woods</hi> Guajac, Juniper, Saſſafras <hi>&amp;c, Of the Roots</hi> of Maſterwort, China, Salſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla, butter-bur, <hi>&amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>For example let the following Mixture be us'd, as has bin oft ſaid, to one or more Spoonfuls, till a Sweat break forth.</p>

               <p n="18">18. If the Form of a Decoction pleaſe any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let him uſe this following oft to ℥ iii or iv, and being well coverd, let him compoſe himſelf to ſleep.</p>
               <p>℞. <hi>Salſaparilla, Smallage-Roots, of each</hi> ℥ i. <hi>the Shavings of Guajac, and Juniper-Wood, of each</hi> ℥ i. ſs. <hi>the Leavs of Carduus Mariae, Scabious, Scordium, of each</hi> M. i. <hi>Elder-Flowers</hi> M ſs. <hi>Milet-Seeds</hi> ℥ ii. <hi>Boil them according to Art in pure Water, adding to</hi>

               <p n="19">19. If the ſeaſon of the year be cold, or the Sick abound with much Phlegm, ℥ ii. of <hi>Aqua Vitae Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thioli,</hi> or any other Aromatic Water may be commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly added to the former Decoction, wherby it may ſerve for more Indications.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The <hi>viſcouſneſs and toughneſs of Phlegm,</hi> and hence <hi>of Lympha may be Corrected</hi> by the ſame alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy propos'd Medicins, to be taken but in a leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and more ſeldom even when the noted Harm ſeems overcomd: when there will not be need to urge a Sweat, but to amend Phlegm, and Lympha gradually only by altering them.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>The Lymphatic Veſſels burſt,</hi> after that they are freed from the noted Obſtruction by Medicins fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiond, will eaſily be conſolidated, as we ſee it happens in the Veſſels of Blood; ſeeing that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Food of any part is indu'd with a faculty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinating being more or leſs clammy or glutinous.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Pains ariſing in the Lims, and eſpecially the upper part of the Arm, and moſt troubleſom in the Night, after that the abundance of a Serous Humor, if there be any, is diminiſht with Hydragogues, and Sudorifics, they may be remov'd by anointing the part grievd with the following Ointment.</p>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:93060:251"/>
               <p>℞. <hi>The Ointment call'd Martiatum, Oil of Worms, of each</hi> ℥ ſs. <hi>Oil of Amber</hi> ℈ i. M.</p>

               <p n="25">25. <hi>The Dropſie of the Breſt</hi> very difficult to be known, though very frequent in theſe places, <hi>may be Cur'd</hi> moſt ſafely, (after an opening and conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion premis'd of the Lymphatic Veſſels obſtructed, that it may not longer be cheriſht) a Sweat being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd, as well by the mentiond Medicins as by a dry Stove, and ſo the Waters ſtanding beſide Nature in the Breſt, being by degrees empti'd through the Pores of the Body: wherby if nothing be effected, and it be certain enough that there is a Dropſie of the Breſt, I ſee not, why it may not be lawful to inſtitute an harmleſs Paracentheſis by an hollow Silver Needle in the Breſt; for by ſuch a ſmall Wound there is no danger to the Sick.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LI.</hi> Of the Preparation of Spittle, as Deprav'd well in the Upper as lower Conglomerated Glandul's of the Jaws.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AS Lympha in all the Conglobated Glandul's, ſo <hi>a peculiar Liquor</hi> is bred <hi>in all the Conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated Glandul's;</hi> which is not carri'd into <hi>Paſſages</hi> common to all, but <hi>peculiar to every one,</hi> and thoſe ending in <hi>Cavities appointed</hi> to every one of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Two Paſſages</hi> call'd <hi>Salival</hi> or <hi>Salivarie</hi> from <hi>Spittle</hi> carri'd through them, empty themſelvs dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on both ſides <hi>into the Mouth,</hi> and ariſing from the upper, as well as lower Conglomerated Glandul's of the Jaws: that I mention not <hi>the infinite little Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels</hi> riſen from ſuch-like Glandul's and alſo <hi>open into the Mouth,</hi> and pouring out the Liquor they contain, firſt obſervd at leaſt as far as I know by the moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and accurat Anatomiſt <hi>Nicolaus Stenonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I judg all <hi>Spittle procedes</hi> partly from <hi>that part of Blood</hi> which is more glutinous then which ſervs the Lympha through <hi>the Arteries,</hi> partly from <hi>the Animal Spirits</hi> carri'd through <hi>the Nervs</hi> to the mentiond Conglomerated Glandul's.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I judg this <hi>Breeding of Spittle</hi> naturally <hi>Inſipid</hi> and eaſie to be mixt with any Liquor <hi>is deprav d;</hi> 1. When it is <hi>more Sparing.</hi> 2. When it is bred <hi>more Plenteous.</hi> 3. When it is prepar'd <hi>many ways peccant in ſenſible qualities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Spittle is bred more Sparing,</hi> then it ought, 1. <hi>by
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:93060:252"/>defect of its Matter,</hi> as oft as <hi>it is not ſuppli'd</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Food, ſuch as Broths made of the Fleſh of Brutes, Milk, more thick Drink, ſtronger Beer, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeem to be the chief: or it is carri'd another way, whether it remain within the Body in a various Dropſie, or be effus'd without the Body in a Looſneſs, or an over-excretion of Urin, or Sweat.</p>
               <p n="6">6. 2. <hi>By the fault of its Ways,</hi> through which <hi>the Matter requir'd is carri'd to the ſaid Glandul's,</hi> the greater Arteries, and ſomtimes alſo Nervs being cut aſunder, obſtructed, or preſt; whence ſome Defect of Spittle at leaſt muſt happen.</p>
               <p n="7">7. 3. <hi>By the Fault of the Glandul's themſelvs,</hi> when they are unfit to ſtrein through, or admit the mentiond-Matter, or to change it and turn it into Spittle. Although it is not yet well known, how thoſe Glandul's are affected and conſtituted according to Nature to do this Office.</p>
               <p n="8">8. On the contrary <hi>Spittle is bred</hi> ſomtimes <hi>more plenteous,</hi> (as it is known to befal certain Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and Spitting Perſons thence ſo call'd, and to ſome Sick People troubled with a voluntary Spitting, and that more abundant or ſparing); 1. By reaſon <hi>of the abundance of Salivary Matter,</hi> ſomtimes from the large uſe of more Liquid Food, eſpecially Wine a little ſowr; ſomtimes from a more ſparing excretion of Urin, or a wonted Sweat.</p>
               <p n="9">9. 2. By reaſon of <hi>the largneſs or multitude of ways carrying the Blood, and Animal Spirits to the Salivarie Glandul's;</hi> becauſe of which more Matter to be chang'd into Spittle is carri'd to the ſaid Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dul's.</p>
               <p n="10">10. 3. By reaſon of <hi>the harm of the Glandul's themſelvs that make Spittle,</hi> becauſe of which more of the Matter of Spittle, then ought, is taken out of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:93060:253"/>the Blood, and chang'd into Spittle; although hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I cannot determin of what kind that harm is or may be.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That <hi>Spittle</hi> is ſomtimes bred <hi>vitious in the ſenſible Qualities,</hi> as well <hi>proper,</hi> as (excepting Quantity, of which we have already ſpoken) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> its <hi>Savour</hi> ſomtimes <hi>Salt,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>Sowr,</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>fulſomly Sweet,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>Bitter,</hi> if that it do not procede from Choler riſing up to the Mouth doth prove: Its <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>leſs Glutinouſneſs</hi> or <hi>Watrineſs</hi> ſomtimes argues the ſame, and if there be any other Changes obſervd at any time, or ſhall be hereafter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd in its <hi>Colour, Odour, Savour, Heat, Cold,</hi> or ſuch-like Qualities.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>The Salt Taſte of Spittle</hi> procedes without doubt from <hi>a Salt Serous Humor in the Blood, the harm of the Salivarie Glandul's</hi> perhaps alſo concurring, becauſe of which they are leſs apt to remove from them, or to overcome that <hi>ſaltneſs of the Serous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. So <hi>the ſowr Taſte of Spittle</hi> is to be referd <hi>to the exceding plenty of an Acid Humor</hi> both in the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> and perhaps moreover to ſome <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Particular Defect of the Animal Spirits</hi> in the Salivarie Glandul's.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>The Taſt of Spittle fulſomly Sweet</hi> and being equal to, or exceding the Sugar of Lead is to be ſought <hi>in ſuch a like Serous Humor</hi> whenceſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding. For it is very difficult to explain exactly all the Changes of the Humors happening in our Body according to their almoſt innumerable Qualities, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we commonly know not what, or what kind of Food the Sick have us'd, and chiefly from what, or what kind of things the Savours, Odours, Colours, and other Qualities of our Humors are ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:93060:253"/>alterd; and that indeed, at leaſt in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by reaſon of experimental (if I may ſo ſay) Chymiſtry neglected by the moſt, and Prejudices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of the moſt inſtead of Experiments, and Things taken for granted and imprudently, ſhall I not ſay impudently obtruded by others.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>The bitter Taſte of Spittle</hi> ariſes either from Choler belcht up, and for ſome time leaving its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in the Mouth, and therfore for ſome time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting all the Spittle; or, when ſuch a belching of Choler has not place, perhaps from the ſame Choler being more in the Serous part of Blood, and mixt to the Matter of Spittle in the Salivarie Glandul's: however I doubt much of this latter manner, ſeeing that I ſcarce ever obſervd the Serous part of Blood bitter.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>More Glutinous Spittle</hi> ariſes from <hi>Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with much Phlegm</hi> alſo <hi>glutinous;</hi> as <hi>more Watry and Fluid Spittle from defect of the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. A <hi>more ſparing Generation of Spittle</hi> to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd; 1. <hi>To the defect</hi> of fit <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>convenient Food, may be Cur'd</hi> by a more liberal Uſe of the ſame: as the Dropſie being Cur'd as oft as its Matter of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment is ſpent or turnd another away; as alſo the Looſneſs being Cur'd, when its Matter is evacuated through it; laſtly, an over-efflux of Urin or Sweat being remov'd, when it happens by the fault of it. The Cure of theſe Diſeaſes ſhall be ſet down elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and that in their proper place.</p>
               <p n="18">18. 2. The <hi>Arteries or Nervs cut aſunder</hi> cannot be Cur'd, and <hi>the harm</hi> thence proceding is not except ſlowly <hi>at leaſt in part repaird;</hi> in as much as the other Arteries and Nervs tending to the ſame parts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by degrees encreaſd, and ſo they at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loſs due to thoſe that are cut in two.</p>
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:93060:254"/>
               <p n="19">19. We have ſpoken and explaind how <hi>an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Compreſſion of thoſe Veſſels</hi> ought and may be Cur'd.</p>
               <p n="20">20. 3. When we know of what kind <hi>the Harm of the Glandul's</hi> is, by reaſon of which Spittle is bred more ſparing, a fit Remedy for it will not be very hard to be found out: although, whilſt both are as yet unknown, a prudent Phyſician may chiefly uſe ſuch Medicins outwardly, as are commonly call'd Strengthners, which are the moſt of Aromatics: For Example; the Ointment <hi>Martiatum,</hi> wherewith the Region of each Jaw may be anointed, in which the Salivarie Glandul's are plac'd; whereby if the Sick receive benefit, that Obſervation may be noted; and at another time in another or the ſame Sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if he cannot bear fat things, a Fomentation may be prepar'd of Aromatic Plants, adding ſomtimes the Spirit of Wine, and ſomtimes an excellent<note n="*" place="margin">I my ſelf have oft experiencd this to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Volatil Salt; by the help of which alſo if the Sick get benefit, thus far the Obſervation may be uſeful both in curing others, and in ſearching out the natural Conſtitution and Harm of the Glandul's. So by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees Man's Knowledg may be enlarg'd, and the Art of Phyſic daily perfected, not to be attaind unleſs with ſtrenuous and iterated Labour.</p>
               <p n="21">21. A <hi>more plenteous breeding of Spittle, may be Cur'd,</hi> 1. <hi>By diminiſhing its Matter,</hi> and daily ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining a little from more Liquid Food; and <hi>by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating</hi> it by <hi>Stool,</hi> or with <hi>

               </p>

               <p n="25">25. 2. <hi>The over-largneſs of the ways</hi> that bring <hi>matter for Spittle,</hi> may be Cur'd chiefly by a Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>ſomwhat Aſtringent and mildly Aromatic</hi> made in Claret-Wine, and oft appli'd hot to the Jaws by a Linnen Cloath: By the help of which the more large ways may by little and little be ſtraitned and ſtrengthned.</p>

               <p n="27">27. The <hi>Saltneſs of Spittle</hi> may be remov'd as well by abſtaining from much uſing of Salt Meat, as by amending the ſaltneſs of the Serous Humor by Crabs-Eyes, Coral, Pearl, Shels, and ſuch-like things meanly calcin'd, and chiefly by <hi>the Pills of Hounds-Tongue, or of Styrax</hi> daily or every other day taken to ii, or iii.

                  <hi>CHAP. LII.</hi> Of the Motion of Spittle into the Mouth and Gullet Deprav'd.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is eaſie for any to try and obſerv that <hi>Spittle</hi> of its own accord <hi>flows into the Mouth</hi> of every one though they think not of it, and may be drawn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more plenteouſly as any ſhall pleaſe, and the ſame is anon <hi>ſwallowd down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This Motion of Spittle into the Mouth is deprav'd,</hi> 1. When it is brought thither <hi>more ſparingly</hi> or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly. 2. When <hi>more plenteouſly,</hi> or <hi>eaſily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Spittle</hi> flows <hi>more ſparingly</hi> into the Mouth; 1. Becauſe of <hi>its defect,</hi> of which we ſpake in the former Chapter. 2. Becauſe of <hi>the Salivary Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Obſtructed, or Preſt, or Cut</hi> in two.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Spittle</hi> flows <hi>more Difficultly</hi> to the Mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>its Glutinouſneſs,</hi> of which we alſo ſpake in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſame <hi>Spittle</hi> is <hi>more Plenteouſly</hi> carri'd into the Mouth; 1. Becauſe of <hi>its abundance;</hi> of which alſo ſee the former Chapter. 2. Becauſe of <hi>the Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varie Paſſages more widend or enlarg'd,</hi> wherfore Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtays not in them its due time, but flowing out continually makes way for the following Spittle of what ſort ſoever, for the moſt part therfore more watry and fluid. This largneſs and widneſs of the Salivarie Paſſages is cauſd oft <hi>by a continual Spitting</hi> accuſtomd after an ill manner. For by how much the more or leſs any ſhall exerciſe any Function, by ſo much it makes the parts miniſtring to it either
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:93060:256"/>more apt, or unfit to perfect the ſame more eaſily and here alſo more abundantly, or more difficultly and here alſo more ſparingly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Spittle</hi> is <hi>more eaſily</hi> carri'd into the Mouth by reaſon of <hi>its thinneſs and fluidneſs</hi> propos'd in the preceding Chapter.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>ſwallowing down of Spittle</hi> admitted into the Mouth is deprav'd, as oft as it either <hi>cannot be at all</hi> or not <hi>without great difficulty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Both theſe Depravations happen eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſtraitneſs of the Jaws, or Gullet, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be aſcrib'd to a Tumor of the Tonſils, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Quincie, ſeldom to a Tumor in the Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let it ſelf, or Fleſh growing out of it: whence the Contraction of the Gullet, and thruſting of what are to be Swallowd down are with difficulty, if at all.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Motion of <hi>the Gullet</hi> may alſo be deprav'd when it is troubled with <hi>a Palſie</hi> or <hi>Convulſion,</hi> or <hi>a Convulſiv Motion</hi> frequent in a Hypochondriac Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. What was mentiond in the former Chapter of the Cure of ſeveral Depravations here nam'd, may thence be requir'd: as alſo from other places, which are or ſhall be ſet down there.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>The Salivarie Paſſages cut in two</hi> cannot be Cur'd: but the Paſſages <hi>Obſtructed,</hi> or <hi>Preſt,</hi> may be cur'd chiefly <hi>by attenuating and cutting Medicins,</hi> us'd as well <hi>to waſh</hi> as to <hi>Foment</hi> thoſe parts.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Salivarie Paſſages more open or wide, may likewiſe be Cur'd by waſhing the Mouth, and Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Jaws by a Decoction prepar'd of ſomwhat binding and mild Aromatics; as is deſcrib'd in the former Chapter <hi>Sect.</hi> 26. But endeavour ſhould alſo be, that the Sick would gradually uncuſtom
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:93060:257"/>themſelvs from a continual Spittle got into an evil Cuſtom.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LIII.</hi> Of the Generation of the Juice of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas deprav'd.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE call <hi>the Humor prepar'd in the Conglomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Glandul's of the Pancreas,</hi> and effus'd through <hi>the Paſſage</hi> of the ſame <hi>into the ſmall Gut</hi> by the name of <hi>the Pancreatic or Melancholic Juice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ſame hath great affinity with Spittle, but is of <hi>a ſomwhat ſowr Taſt</hi> from it inſipid, although ſoon ſowring, we do no longer ſuſpect to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht, but affirm it for certain after the Ingenious Obſervation of <hi>Reguerus de Graaf,</hi> that truly indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrions, and happy Anatomiſt, and formerly our dearly beloved Student not only made in Dogs, but in a Man, and its Juice collected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Juice of the Pancreas</hi> is therfore <hi>naturally ſomwhat ſowr in taſt, prepar'd in the Conglomerated Glandul's of the part of Blood moſt like to it, and of the Animal Spirits; and flowing together continually out of the leſſer Paſſages into the greater, and at length into the greateſt and middle, for the moſt part ſingle, ſeldom double, and hence into the ſmall Gut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Generation</hi> of this Juice <hi>is deprav'd,</hi> 1. When it is bred <hi>more ſparing.</hi> 2. When <hi>more plenteous</hi> 3. When <hi>vitious in manifold ſenſible Qualities, in ſavour, odour, colour, glutinouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Juice is made <hi>more ſparing;</hi> 1. <hi>By the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of fit Matter in the Blood,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Food</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:93060:257"/>very little Acidity too long us'd, or becauſe of it <hi>carri'd another way in the Dropſie,</hi> or <hi>effus'd out of the Body</hi> in a <hi>ſomwhat Acid Sweat,</hi> and <hi>by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>more ſowr;</hi> or in <hi>a Lienteric,</hi> and <hi>Caeliac Looſneſs.</hi> For that which is conjoind with Gripes, and ariſes from a ſharp Acid Humor, is chiefly thought by me for the moſt part to procede from the Juice of the Pancreas more Acid, which although it be pourd out of the Body, yet was it prepar'd in the Pancreas.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſame Juice is bred more Sparing. 2. <hi>By the fault of the Ways,</hi> and chiefly of <hi>the Arteries,</hi> through which Blood is carri'd to the Glandul's of the Pancreas, if it happen at any time that they be <hi>obſtructed,</hi> or <hi>preſs'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. 3. By the fault of <hi>the Glandul's of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas unfit to ſeparate commodiouſly the ſomwhat ſowr part of Blood</hi> from the reſt, and further <hi>to prepare it with the Animal Spirits</hi> into the mentiond Juice.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Juice of the Pancreas is generated <hi>more Plenteous;</hi> 1. Becauſe of the <hi>abundance of Matter</hi> made fit to breed it in the Body and Blood, and by ſuch-like <hi>Food</hi> long and much us'd, and by <hi>the wonted Evacuations of ſomwhat ſowr Humors ſuppreſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. 2. Becauſe of <hi>the plenty and greatneſs of the Arteries and Nervs</hi> carri'd to the Pancreas; wherfore much Matter fit to breed the Juice of the Pancreas is carri'd thither.</p>
               <p n="10">10. 3. Becauſe of <hi>the peculiar conſtitution of the Glandul's of the Pancreas</hi> favouring the breeding of much Melancholic Juice: Although here alſo we as yet doubt in determining and deſcribing their noted vitious, as well as natural and laudable Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Juice of the Pancreas is bred <hi>vitious in Taſte;</hi> 1. When it is made <hi>too ſowr,</hi> and that then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:93060:258"/>of <hi>the over-uſe of ſowr Food, Sauces, or Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins;</hi> and becauſe of <hi>a delay of the laudable Juice</hi> made <hi>in certain of its leſſer Paſſages obſtructed,</hi> whence the ſame becoms anon more ſowr, and being again joind to the reſt, infects it all at leaſt for that time, and likewiſe makes it more ſowr then it is wont to be: as that is for the moſt part notably obſervd in the beginning of the Fits of Intermitting Fevers with Cold, the off ſpring of a more ſharp ſowr Humor.</p>
               <p n="12">12. 2. When it is bred <hi>leſs ſowr,</hi> and indeed then <hi>becauſe of a more ſparing,</hi> or <hi>no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of ſowr Food, and Sauces;</hi> and <hi>becauſe of a frequent and plenteous uſe of things contrary to it,</hi> ſuch as are Chalk, Crabs-Eyes, Pearl, Coral, and ſuch-like oft mentiond, as alſo both fixt and volatil Salts; and <hi>becauſe of much evacuation of an Acid Humor by Sweat, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. 3. When it is bred <hi>Salt</hi> like <hi>Pickle;</hi> by ſuch a like <hi>ſerous Humor</hi> abounding in the Body, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>Food ſeaſond with much Salt</hi> long taken, and by a troubleſom and perſevering <hi>ſtoppage of the Head,</hi> corrupting the laudable Humors into Humors Salt like Pickle, or ſuch-like Lympha.</p>
               <p n="14">14. 4. When the ſame Juice is bred <hi>Tart,</hi> and that both becauſe of <hi>ſuch-like Food; and Medicins</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more plenteouſly or too long, and by <hi>an exceding ſorrow of Mind,</hi> and chiefly when unexpected, and <hi>a great</hi> unthought-of <hi>Terror.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. 5. When the ſame Juice is bred <hi>ill-ſavourd,</hi> which chiefly happens, when there is a <hi>Corruption in the Pancreas,</hi> to wit, <hi>the making of Matter</hi> after an Inflammation, wherof when any is joind to the Juice of the Pancreas, then it gives it its ill ſavour.</p>
               <p n="16">16. 6. When <hi>the Colour</hi> of the ſame Juice being <hi>like Phlegm,</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> is chang'd into any other not like its natural Colour; which may happen, when
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:93060:258"/>
                  <hi>ſome pure,</hi> or <hi>corrupted Blood is mixt</hi> with it, and doth more or leſs alter its natural colour.</p>
               <p n="17">17. 7. When the Juice of the Pancreas is made <hi>more Glutinous,</hi> and that becauſe of much <hi>Phlegm like it</hi> being in the Body, and joind to the Blood, and then infecting the other Humors, and this eſpecially with its viſcouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Seeing that more vitious Qualities of this Juice do not at preſent occur, let us procede ſtreight-way to the Cure of the mentiond Depravations in its Generation.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>A more ſparing Generation of the Juice of the Pancreas may be Cur'd;</hi> 1. <hi>By uſing</hi> more abundantly <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Sauces ſomwhat ſowr,</hi> when this Evil hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens for want of them; or by curing <hi>an Acid Dropſie or Sweat,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin;</hi> or <hi>a Lienteric,</hi> or <hi>Coeliac Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> when it procedes from them; of which we have treated before, or yet may anon.</p>
               <p n="20">20. 2. By <hi>Opening an Obſtruction of the Arteries,</hi> by cutting and attenuating Medicins oft already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; <hi>or by removing their Compreſſion,</hi> by freeing them from Bands or Tumors ſtraitning their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
               <p n="21">21. 3. It will be hard to tell how <hi>the harm of the Glandul's of the Pancreas,</hi> by reaſon of which its Juice is bred more ſparing in them, <hi>may be Cur'd,</hi> ſeeing that we know not as yet the due Conſtitution of the Glandul's to prepare this mentiond natural Juice: yet becauſe a ſomwhat-ſowr Juice is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or made in them, I ſuppoſe <hi>Medicins mildly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatical and chiefly Volatil Salts joind with ſomwhat-Acid Liquors</hi> may very probably be uſeful here; For Example, The Volatil Salt of Amber, the Salt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac made more pure by a repeted Sublimation, and ſeveral others induſtriouſly prepar'd.</p>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:93060:259"/>

                  <hi>CHAP. LIV.</hi> Of the Motion of the Juice of the Pancreas, and its Efferveſcency with Choler deprav'd.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Suppoſe <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas</hi> is continually ſeparated in its Glandul's from the Maſs of Blood, and is farther elaborated, and perfected with the Animal Spirits, and <hi>moves into the greater,</hi> and at length <hi>the middle Paſſage,</hi> and hence into <hi>the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſmall Gut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Motion of the Juice of the Pancreas through the leſs, greater, and greateſt Paſſage to the Cavity of the thin Gut may be deprav'd ſeveral ways,</hi> and that ſomtimes according to <hi>the whole Maſs of the Juice,</hi> ſomtimes according to <hi>ſome part of it only:</hi> whilſt there is either <hi>None,</hi> or it procedes <hi>more ſlowly, and difficultly,</hi> or <hi>more ſpeedily, becauſe more eaſily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſuppoſe <hi>the Motion of the Juice of the Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> through its Paſſages to the ſmall Gut, is either <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> or <hi>never wholly deficient:</hi> Which will only come to paſs, if it may happen, <hi>from an Obſtruction of the greateſt and middle Paſſage by moſt glutinous Phlegm ſticking, and in like manner coagulated and faſtned about its Orifice;</hi> which can ſcarce remain there for a ſpace, but would anon be looſend by the Juice perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually coming, or the Sick be caſt into preſent danger of Life: to which unexpected Death may not often follow, what prudent Man will deny, or by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat obſervation in a Dead Body, and made before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand by this Paſſage will raſhly affirm.</p>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:93060:261"/>
               <p n="4">4. I indeed remember that I have ſomtimes ſeen glutinous, and plenteous Phlegm ſticking, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering in this Paſſage, and not eaſily giving place or to be remov'd thence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. None who have red thoſe things with an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mind, which I concluded in <hi>Chap.</hi> 30. <hi>Sect.</hi> 61, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this Book according to Experience, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make tryal, ſhall recal the ſame things to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience by his own Sences can well deny that <hi>ſome part of the Juice of the Pancreas is oft hindred wholly,</hi> at leaſt for a ſeaſon, <hi>in its Motion through the leſs, and ſide-Paſſages,</hi> to the middle and greateſt Paſſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>an Obſtruction</hi> riſen <hi>by Viſcous Phlegm</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When <hi>the Juice of the Pancreas</hi> is ſtopt after the ſame manner in certain Paſſages, then any may ſee <hi>it is all mov'd more ſparingly to the ſmall Gut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The Juice of the Pancreas may be mov'd <hi>more difficultly, and therfore ſlowly</hi> alſo through its Paſſages to the ſmall Gut, as oft as it is <hi>more glutinous:</hi> of which we ſpake in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The ſame may be mov'd more eaſily, and ſo ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> when it is <hi>more Watry</hi> and <hi>Fluid</hi> then is wont to be, a Cauſe of which may be <hi>much watry and diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical drink,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> and many <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> the Spaw, Swalbats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence a Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo ſo frequent, moſt commonly beneficial ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hurtful to the Sick, is perhaps to be deduc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other of their admirable effects; in as much as they haſten not only through the Kidneys to the Bladder, but alſo through the Pancreas to the ſmall Gut; nor do they only render the Juice of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas more fluid, but alſo make it leſs ſowr or tart, the moſt frequent cauſe of a ſlow and coſtive Body; wherfore the Excrements are alſo eaſily diluted, and
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:93060:262"/>Choler it ſelf is haſtned more then uſual to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If at any time a Phyſician ſuſpect that moſt plenteous glutinous Phlegm doth not only abound in the Body, but that much of the ſame is carri'd every whither, and ſo to the Pancreas, ſo that there is fear that the middle and common Paſſage of the Pancreas not only may be, but is obſtructed wholly by it, by reaſon of extreme Anguiſh ſuddenly affecting the Sick; I cannot then think that <hi>an Acid Spirit, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of Nitre,</hi> as the <hi>moſt piercing,</hi> but mixt <hi>with ſtrong Wine,</hi> or <hi>its Spirit</hi> will then be ill us'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſuch an evil; wherby <hi>the noted Obſtruction</hi> may not only <hi>be Opend,</hi> but moreover <hi>the defect of the Juice of the Pancreas may be ſuppli'd</hi> in perpetuating an Efferveſcency with Choler.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I can eaſily admit that <hi>an Obſtruction</hi> plac'd about <hi>the Orifice of the Paſſage of the Pancreas</hi> opening <hi>into the ſmall Gut,</hi> may be immediatly remov'd by reaſon of the commerce of an Acid Spirit with Phlegm, by the mentiond Medicin taken in at the Mouth, and carri'd to the ſmall Gut, (without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tranſmitting it through the Lacteal Veins, the Paſſage of the Thorax, the upper Hollow Vein, the Right Ventricle of the Heart, the Artery and Vein of the Lungs, hence through the Left Ventricle of the Heart the Great Artery to the Pancreas) whil'ſt this Phlegm is looſend and diſſolvd by it piercing thither.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>The more ſparing Motion of the Melancholic Juice</hi> riſen from <hi>an Obſtruction of the leſſer Paſſages of the Pancreas,</hi> may be reſtor'd by Remedies propos'd in the fore-cited 30th <hi>Chap. Sect.</hi> 132, &amp;c. as alſo in <hi>Chap.</hi> 50. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>A more ſpeedy Motion of the Juice of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas</hi> made by reaſon of <hi>its Watrineſs</hi> and <hi>Volatility,</hi>
                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:93060:262"/>perhaps proceding either from <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> or <hi>Volatil Salts more abundantly taken</hi> may be allaid <hi>by abſtaining from farther uſe of them,</hi> and mean while <hi>uſing</hi> thoſe things that may give it a greater conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſuch as are <hi>ſharp and tart things,</hi> oft taken in a ſmall quantity.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AS the beſt part of Food, and that which is uſeful to the Body is ſeparated from the Food taken in, and fermented in the Ventricle, being fluid, and of a milky colour, and carri'd under the name of Chyle through the Lacteal Veins toward the Heart, whil'ſt the unuſeful and excrementitious parts go away by Stool, keeping a thicker conſiſtency; ſo again <hi>the ſerous ſuperfluous part is ſeparated in the Kidneys out of the Chyle chang'd into Blood;</hi> which whilſt the principal part of Blood flows back to the reſt of its Maſs, it diſtills through their capillar fleſhy parts into its Funnel, and is ſent hence through the Ureters to the Urinar Bladder, ſo nam'd from the mentiond Serous part then conſtituting Urin; in which it is gatherd by little and little, till it be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward voided again.</p>
               <pb n="478" facs="tcp:93060:263"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Glandulous fleſhy parts</hi> are obſervd to be ſhut up in the ſubſtance of the Kidneys, and ſtretchd forward into membranous Pipes joind to its Funnel, and having peculiar Paſſages appropriated to the dropping of Urin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin</hi> becauſe it is obſervd Salt even in thoſe, (in whom the Serous Part of their Blood is found inſipid) any may ſuſpect and not without cauſe, <hi>that the Matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin undergoes ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Change in the Kidneys, while it is ſtreind through the mentiond fleſhy Parts;</hi> although it ſeem to me at leaſt very probable that the Blood as well as Chyle is prepar'd in the Heart in its Vital Efferveſcency for the Separation of the Urinar Serous Part, and that the ſame is abſolvd in the Kidneys; although I have not hitherto attaind the reaſon of it, however I think it happens after the manner of <hi>Precipitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This Separation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin is deprav'd;</hi> 1. When there is <hi>None.</hi> 2. When it is <hi>more Sparing.</hi> 3. When <hi>more Plenteous.</hi> 4. When by reaſon of both <hi>the Liquor,</hi> and what is <hi>Containd</hi> in it, it haps ſeveral ways <hi>viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> in <hi>Colour, Odour, Savour, Thickneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There happens <hi>No Separation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin</hi> in the Kidneys oft by the fault of <hi>the fleſhy parts Obſtructed, or otherwiſe ill-affected;</hi> ſeldom perhaps by fault of <hi>the Blood,</hi> or <hi>its ſerous part,</hi> to wit, <hi>unfit for its Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> and that becauſe of <hi>a more intire mixing of the Heterogeneal Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Thoſe fleſhy parts may be Obſtructed by much and glutinous Phlegm</hi> any ways looſend in the ſmall Gut and confuſd with the Blood, being afterward <hi>again coagulated in the Kidneys,</hi> together vitiating their <hi>fleſhy parts</hi> by an External Cold imprudently receivd, and there <hi>ſevering from the Blood</hi> in part at leaſt with the Urinar Serous Part, <hi>and ſticking in the fleſhy
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:93060:263"/>parts,</hi> and <hi>by degrees filling and obſtructing their Paſſages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The Harm</hi> com'd <hi>to the fleſhy parts by external Cold,</hi> may perhaps be <hi>a ſtraitning and binding of their ſpongie parts,</hi> by reaſon of which the Phlegm diſſolvd by the Serous Liquor flowing through may the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier ſtick, and be ſtopt in them, till at length filling their Paſſages it may hinder farther paſſage of Urin through them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The Heterogeneal parts of Blood are more intirely mixt,</hi> and ſo the ſame becoms <hi>unfit for a Separation of its Serous part,</hi> as oft as <hi>the Acidity of Lympha</hi> is <hi>more ſharp,</hi> ſo that <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Blood grows,</hi> too much <hi>together, its alone fluidneſs remaining.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>This Acidity of Lympha</hi> may become <hi>ſharper,</hi> both <hi>in the Conglobated Glandul's,</hi> and <hi>in the Conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated Glandul's of the Pancreas</hi> by <hi>an external very ſharp Cold,</hi> or <hi>a great and unexpected Sorrow or Terror of Mind, the notable abuſe of Acid things</hi> and thus far <hi>very ſharp,</hi> firſt concurring and preceding.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>The Separation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin</hi> becoms <hi>more Sparing,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>the ſame but lighter Cauſes;</hi> as <hi>a Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and chiefly <hi>Sweat plenteous.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LVIII.</hi> Of a deprav'd Excretion of Sweat.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AS Vomiting, ſo alſo <hi>Sweating</hi> ſeems not to me <hi>a Natural Excretion,</hi> but either <hi>Non-natural,</hi> or <hi>Preternatural,</hi> or <hi>Phyſical;</hi> and that either <hi>Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,</hi> or <hi>Critical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I do not judg <hi>Sweat</hi> to be <hi>a Natural Excretion,</hi> becauſe in Healthy People moderatly uſing the Non-natural things I have not hitherto obſervd any Sweat breaking forth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I judg <hi>the Excretion of Sweat</hi> to be <hi>Non-natural,</hi> as oft as a Non-natural thing exceding the Golden Mediocrity mov's it, as hot or rainy Weather, much Meat, or Drink, and chiefly hot; a more vehement Motion of Body, a great and burning anxiety of Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ceaſing Sweating ceaſes again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I judg a <hi>Sweat Preter-natural,</hi> which is raiſd by the Humors corrupted, or by Poiſon taken in, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening or killing a Man.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I call <hi>a Sweat Phyſical,</hi> which is either <hi>Critical</hi> driven forward for the profit and health of the Sick of its own accord by the Humors that are in Man, or <hi>Artificial</hi> by Art by Medicins taken within the Body or us'd outwardly as a Bath, Rubbings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. This <hi>Excretion of Sweat</hi> is to be thought <hi>deprav'd,</hi> 1. when <hi>a wonted</hi> and neither <hi>troubleſom nor hurtful Sweat</hi> to the Party <hi>is wholly, or in part hindred</hi> whence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p n="7">7. 2. When <hi>a Non-natural Sweat is ſuddenly ſtopt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. 3. When a <hi>Phyſical,</hi> or <hi>Critical,</hi> or <hi>Artificial Sweat</hi> is more, or leſs hinderd.</p>
               <p n="9">9. 4. When <hi>ſome of theſe Sweats is ſo urg'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſd,</hi> that a Man is worſe by it.</p>
               <pb n="507" facs="tcp:93060:277"/>
               <p n="10">10. 5. When <hi>a Sweat breaks forth much weakening a Man with, or without a Fever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. 6. When <hi>an Inſipid Sweat,</hi> which is wont to be moſt uſual and not in the leaſt hurtful, breaks forth <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Bitter,</hi> or <hi>Sow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="12">12. <hi>A wonted Sweat</hi> not hurtful befals a Man <hi>in a neutral ſtate,</hi> and ſo to one that is <hi>leſs healthy,</hi> and it follows (at leaſt in my eſteem) <hi>ſuch a Conſtitution of the ſomwhat-contrary Humors departing from a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mediocrity,</hi> by which <hi>an Efferveſcency producing a uſeful Sweat</hi> may be raiſd, and ſo preſerving the Blood from a corruption that might breed a notable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: ſeeing that it being hindred, or remov'd, the ſame Man is eaſily overtaken by a grievous Diſeaſe: which is hindred wholly, or in part by more grievous or lighter Cauſes to be propos'd in the following <hi>Sect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. 2. <hi>A Non-natural Sweat is ſuddenly ſtopt</hi> both by <hi>the external Cold</hi> of Air, Water, a Shirt, Bed, or other Coverings, or Cloaths entring into the Body running down of a Sweat, and every where open through the Pores, and not only binding them, but moreover bringing a notable Change, to wit, a Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, or ſome other hurtful thing to all the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors much mov'd every way through every Veſſel; and by <hi>the alone removing of Coverings, or Cloaths</hi> and making the Body naked; and by <hi>a ſudden reſt of the Body much mov'd before;</hi> and by <hi>an unthought-of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> ſtopping, or at leaſt troubling any motion of the things Containd.</p>
               <p n="14">14. 3. <hi>A Phyſical,</hi> and as well <hi>Critical,</hi> as <hi>Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sweat is more, or leſs hindred</hi> by the ſame <hi>external Cold</hi> imprudently receivd into the naked Body, or by a <hi>grievous and unexpected Motion of Mind,</hi> chiefly by an aſtoniſhing <hi>Sorrow</hi> or <hi>Terror.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. 4. Any <hi>Sweat of it ſelf hurtleſs</hi> or <hi>uſeful</hi> may

               <p n="16">16. 5. <hi>A Sweat</hi> coming forth of its own accord <hi>with or without a Fever,</hi> and <hi>weakening a Man,</hi> and therfore <hi>preternatural,</hi> ſeems to ariſe from a vitious Efferveſcency of the Humors flowing together to the ſmall Gut, and breeding <hi>a diſſolving,</hi> and <hi>cutting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor;</hi> by which carri'd to the Heart the univerſal Maſs of Blood is ſo chang'd, and diſſolvd, that its Serous parts do eaſily ſeparate from the reſt and break forth through the Pores of the Body in the form of a Sweat.</p>
               <p n="17">17. I judg that this <hi>Liquor</hi> doth moſt reſemble <hi>a ſomwhat-Acid Volatil Salt,</hi> ſeeing that Sweat is eaſily ſent forth by one like it.</p>
               <p n="18">18. 6. <hi>A Salt</hi> (but like Pickle) <hi>Sweat</hi> breaks forth from <hi>ſuch a like Serous part</hi> being in the Blood: as <hi>a Bitter Sweat from Choler</hi> keeping its bitterneſs, and mixt with the Serous part of Blood: but <hi>an Acid Sweat</hi> from <hi>Lympha, or the Juice of the Pancreas more ſowr,</hi> and keeping its taſte in the Serous part of Blood.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>A Diminiſht,</hi> or <hi>Suppreſt</hi> wholly harmleſs, or uſeful <hi>Sweat may be encreaſd, or reſtord,</hi> 1. <hi>By remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> all its <hi>Cauſes.</hi> 2. <hi>By ſtirring up Heat in the Air.</hi> 3. <hi>By covering the Body</hi> with warmd and ſufficient <hi>Cloaths, or Coverings.</hi> 4. <hi>By giving Food,</hi> and chiefly <hi>ſuch as may be Drunk,</hi> both <hi>plenteous and hot,</hi> as Broth, Wine, Beer, and ſuch-like. 5. <hi>By moving and ſtirring the Body</hi> again (prepoſterouſly given to reſt) as much as ſtrength ſhall permit. 6. <hi>By driving</hi> out of the Mind great <hi>Sorrow and Terror</hi> by effectual reaſons. 7. <hi>By uſing Sudorifies,</hi> eſpecially the liquid, and ſpiritous.

               <p n="20">20. <hi>A Sweat too much encreaſd,</hi> or <hi>of it ſelf hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and more and more <hi>weakening</hi> a Man <hi>may be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend,</hi> and at length <hi>remov'd,</hi> 1. <hi>By keeping the Body meanly coverd,</hi> yet not naked; 2. <hi>By bewaring of the Volatil, and</hi> alſo <hi>Spiritous Acid Salt;</hi> Yea, 3. <hi>By u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe things that fix an Acid Salt,</hi> Chalk, Coral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
